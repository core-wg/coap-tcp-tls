--- abstract

The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), although inspired by HTTP, was designed to use UDP
instead of TCP. The message layer of the CoAP over UDP protocol includes support for
reliable delivery, simple congestion control, and flow control.

Some environments benefit from the availability of CoAP carried over reliable
transports such as TCP or TLS. This document outlines the changes required to use
CoAP over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets transports. It also formally updates {{RFC7641}}
for use with these transports.

# Introduction {#introduction}

The [Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)](#RFC7252) was designed
for Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, assuming that UDP {{RFC0768}} 
or DTLS {{RFC6347}} over UDP can be used unimpeded. UDP is a good choice
for transferring small amounts of data across networks that follow the IP
architecture.

Some CoAP deployments need to integrate well with existing enterprise
infrastructures, where UDP-based protocols may not be well-received or may
even be blocked by firewalls. Middleboxes that are unaware of CoAP usage for
IoT can make the use of UDP brittle, resulting in lost or malformed packets.

Emerging standards such as Lightweight Machine to Machine {{LWM2M}} currently use CoAP over UDP
as a transport and require support for CoAP over TCP to address the issues above and to protect
investments in existing CoAP implementations and deployments. Although HTTP/2 could also potentially
address these requirements, there would be additional costs and delays introduced by such a transition.
Currently, there are also fewer HTTP/2 implementations available for constrained devices in
comparison to CoAP.

To address these requirements, this document defines how to transport CoAP over TCP, 
CoAP over TLS, and CoAP over WebSockets. {{layering}} illustrates the layering:

Where NATs are present, CoAP over TCP can help with their traversal.
NATs often calculate expiration timers based on the transport layer protocol
being used by application protocols. Many NATs maintain TCP-based NAT bindings
for longer periods based on the assumption that a transport layer protocol, such
as TCP, offers additional information about the session life cycle. UDP, on the other
hand, does not provide such information to a NAT and timeouts tend to be much 
shorter {{HomeGateway}}.

Some environments may also benefit from the ability of TCP to exchange
larger payloads, such as firmware images, without application layer
segmentation and to utilize the more sophisticated congestion control
capabilities provided by many TCP implementations. Note that there is
ongoing work to add more elaborate congestion control to CoAP (see {{-cocoa}}).

CoAP may be integrated into a Web environment where the front-end
uses CoAP over UDP from IoT devices to a cloud infrastructure and then CoAP
over TCP between the back-end services. A TCP-to-UDP gateway can be used at
the cloud boundary to communicate with the UDP-based IoT device.

To allow IoT devices to better communicate in these demanding environments, CoAP
needs to support different transport protocols, namely TCP {{RFC0793}},
in some situations secured by TLS {{RFC5246}}.

In addition, some corporate networks only allow Internet access via a HTTP proxy.
In this case, the best transport for CoAP might be the [WebSocket Protocol](#RFC6455).
The WebSocket protocol provides two-way communication between a client
and a server after upgrading an [HTTP/1.1](#RFC7230) connection and may
be available in an environment that blocks CoAP over UDP. Another scenario
for CoAP over WebSockets is a CoAP application running inside a web browser
without access to connectivity other than HTTP and WebSockets.

This document specifies how to access resources using CoAP requests
and responses over the TCP/TLS and WebSocket protocols. This allows
connectivity-limited applications to obtain end-to-end CoAP
connectivity either by communicating CoAP directly with a CoAP server
accessible over a TCP/TLS or WebSocket connection or via a CoAP intermediary
that proxies CoAP requests and responses between different transports,
such as between WebSockets and UDP.

{{observing}} updates [Observing Resources in the Constrained Application Protocol](#RFC7641)
for use with CoAP over reliable transports. {{RFC7641}} is an extension to the CoAP core
protocol that enables CoAP clients to "observe" a resource on a CoAP server. (The client
retrieves a representation of a resource and registers to be notified by the server when
the representation is updated.)

## Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.

This document assumes that readers are familiar with the terms and
concepts that are used in {{RFC6455}}, {{RFC7252}}, {{RFC7641}}, and {{-block}}.

The term "reliable transport" is used only to refer to transport protocols such
as TCP which provide reliable and ordered delivery of a byte-stream. 

BERT Option:
:	A Block1 or Block2 option that includes an SZX value of 7.
{: vspace='0'}
BERT Block:
:	The payload of a CoAP message that is affected by a BERT Option in
	descriptive usage (Section 2.1 of {{-block}}).
{: vspace='0'}

For simplicity, a Payload Marker (0xFF) is present in all examples for message formats:

~~~~
    ...
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1|    Payload (if any) ...
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~~

The Payload Marker indicates the start of the optional payload and is absent for zero-length
payloads (see section 3 of {{RFC7252}}).

# CoAP over TCP

The request/response interaction model of CoAP over TCP is the same as CoAP over UDP.
The primary differences are in the message layer. The message layer of CoAP over UDP
supports optional reliability by defining four Types of messages: Confirmable,
Non-confirmable, Acknowledgement, and Reset. In addition, messages include a
Message ID to relate Acknowledgments to Confirmable messages and to detect duplicate
messages. 

## Messaging Model 

Conceptually, CoAP over TCP replaces most of the message layer of CoAP over UDP
with a framing mechanism on top of the byte-stream provided by TCP/TLS,
conveying the length information for each message that on datagram transports
is provided by the UDP/DTLS datagram layer.

TCP ensures reliable message transmission, so the message layer of CoAP over TCP
is not required to support acknowledgements or to detect duplicate
messages. As a result, both the Type and Message ID fields are no longer required
and are removed from the CoAP over TCP message format.

{{fig-flow-comparison}} illustrates the difference between CoAP over UDP and
CoAP over reliable transport. The removed Type and Message ID fields
are indicated by dashes.

## Opening Handshake {#tcp-handshake}

Both the client and the server MUST send a Capabilities and Settings message (CSM see {{csm}})
as its first message on the connection. This message establishes the initial settings and
capabilities for the endpoint such as maximum message size or support for block-wise transfers.
The absence of options in the CSM indicates that base values are assumed.

To avoid unnecessary latency, a client MAY send additional messages without waiting to receive
the server CSM; however, it is important to note that the server CSM might advertise capabilities
that impact how a client is expected to communicate with the server. For example, the server CSM
could advertise a Max-Message-Size option (see {{max-message-size}}) that is smaller than the base value (1152). 

Clients and servers MUST treat a missing or invalid CSM as a connection error and abort
the connection (see {{sec-abort}}). 

## Message Format {#tcp-message-format}

The CoAP message format defined in {{RFC7252}}, as shown in 
{{CoAP-Header}}, relies on the datagram transport (UDP, or DTLS over
UDP) for keeping the individual messages separate and for providing 
length information.

{: #CoAP-Header title='RFC 7252 defined CoAP Message Format'}

The CoAP over TCP message format is very similar to the format
specified for CoAP over UDP. The differences are as follows:

* Since the underlying TCP connection provides retransmissions and
  deduplication, there is no need for the reliability mechanisms
  provided by CoAP over UDP. The Type (T) and Message ID fields in
  the CoAP message header are elided.

* The Version (Vers) field is elided as well. In contrast to the message format
  of CoAP over UDP, the message format for CoAP over TCP does not include a version
  number. CoAP is defined in {{RFC7252}} with a version number of 1. At this time,
  there is no known reason to support version numbers different from 1. If version
  negotiation needs to be addressed in the future, then Capabilities and Settings Messages
  (CSM see {{csm}}) have been specifically designed to enable such a potential feature.

* In a stream oriented transport protocol such as TCP, a form of message 
  delimitation is needed. For this purpose, CoAP over TCP introduces a 
  length field with variable size. {{fig-frame}} shows the adjusted CoAP 
  message format with a modified structure for the fixed header (first 4
  bytes of the CoAP over UDP header), which includes the length information of
  variable size, shown here as an 8-bit length.

Length (Len):
: 4-bit unsigned integer. A value between 0 and 12 directly indicates the
  length of the message in bytes starting with the first bit of the Options
  field. Three values are reserved for special constructs:

    13:
    : An 8-bit unsigned integer (Extended Length) follows the initial byte and indicates
      the length of options/payload minus 13.

    14:
    : A 16-bit unsigned integer (Extended Length) in network byte order follows the
      initial byte and indicates the length of options/payload minus
      269.

    15:
    : A 32-bit unsigned integer (Extended Length) in network byte order follows the
      initial byte and indicates the length of options/payload minus
      65805.

The encoding of the Length field is modeled on CoAP Options (see section 3.1 of {{RFC7252}}). 

The following figures show the message format for the 0-bit, 16-bit, and 
the 32-bit variable length cases.

The semantics of the other CoAP header fields are left unchanged.

## Message Transmission

CoAP requests and responses are exchanged asynchronously over the
TCP/TLS connection. A CoAP client can send multiple requests
without waiting for a response and the CoAP server can return
responses in any order. Responses MUST be returned over the same
connection as the originating request. Concurrent requests are
differentiated by their Token, which is scoped locally to the
connection.

The connection is bi-directional, so requests can be sent both by
the entity that established the connection and the remote host.

Retransmission and deduplication of messages is provided by the
TCP/TLS protocol. 

# CoAP over WebSockets {#websockets-overview}

CoAP over WebSockets can be used in a number of configurations. The
most basic configuration is a CoAP client retrieving or updating a
CoAP resource located at a CoAP server that exposes a WebSocket endpoint
({{arch-1}}). The CoAP client acts as the WebSocket client, establishes
a WebSocket connection, and sends a CoAP request, to which the CoAP server
returns a CoAP response. The WebSocket connection can be used for any number
of requests.

The challenge with this configuration is how to identify a resource in the
namespace of the CoAP server. When the WebSocket protocol is used by
a dedicated client directly (i.e., not from a web page through a web browser),
the client can connect to any WebSocket endpoint. {{coap-ws-scheme}} and
{{coaps-ws-scheme}} define new URI schemes that enable the client to identify
both a WebSocket endpoint and the path and query of the CoAP resource within that
endpoint. When the WebSocket protocol is used from a web page, the choices are more
limited {{RFC6454}}, but the challenge persists.

Another possible configuration is to set up a CoAP forward proxy
at the WebSocket endpoint. Depending on what transports are available
to the proxy, it could forward the request to a CoAP server with a
CoAP UDP endpoint ({{arch-2}}), an SMS endpoint (a.k.a.&nbsp;mobile phone),
or even another WebSocket endpoint. The client specifies the resource to be
updated or retrieved in the Proxy-Uri Option.

A third possible configuration is a CoAP server running inside a web browser
({{arch-3}}). The web browser initially connects to a WebSocket endpoint and
is then reachable through the WebSocket server. When no connection exists, the
CoAP server is unreachable. Because the WebSocket server is the only way to
reach the CoAP server, the CoAP proxy should be a Reverse Proxy.

Further configurations are possible, including those where a
WebSocket connection is established through an HTTP proxy.

CoAP over WebSockets is intentionally very similar to CoAP
over UDP. Therefore, instead of presenting CoAP over WebSockets as a
new protocol, this document specifies it as a series of deltas from
{{RFC7252}}.

## Opening Handshake {#handshake}

Before CoAP requests and responses are exchanged, a WebSocket
connection is established as defined in Section 4 of {{RFC6455}}.
{{handshake-example}} shows an example.

The WebSocket client MUST include the subprotocol name "coap" in
the list of protocols, which indicates support for the protocol
defined in this document. Any later, incompatible versions of
CoAP or CoAP over WebSockets will use a different subprotocol
name.

The WebSocket client includes the hostname of the WebSocket server
in the Host header field of its handshake as per {{RFC6455}}. The Host
header field also indicates the default value of the Uri-Host Option in
requests from the WebSocket client to the WebSocket server.

## Message Format {#websocket-message-format}

Once a WebSocket connection is established, CoAP requests and
responses can be exchanged as WebSocket messages. Since CoAP uses a
binary message format, the messages are transmitted in binary data
frames as specified in Sections 5 and 6 of {{RFC6455}}.

The message format shown in {{ws-message-format}} is the same as the CoAP
over TCP message format (see {{tcp-message-format}}) with one restriction. The
Length (Len) field MUST be set to zero because the WebSockets frame contains
the length.

{: #ws-message-format title='CoAP Message Format over WebSockets' artwork-align="center"}

The CoAP over TCP message format eliminates the Version field defined in
CoAP over UDP. If CoAP version negotiation is required in the future,
CoAP over WebSockets can address the requirement by the definition of a
new subprotocol identifier that is negotiated during the opening handshake.

Requests and response messages can be fragmented as specified in
Section 5.4 of {{RFC6455}}, though typically they are sent unfragmented
as they tend to be small and fully buffered before transmission. The WebSocket
protocol does not provide means for multiplexing. If it is not desirable for a
large message to monopolize the connection, requests and responses can be
transferred in a block-wise fashion as defined in {{-block}}.

Empty messages (Code 0.00) MUST be ignored by the recipient (see also
{{sec-ping}}).

## Message Transmission {#requests-responses}

CoAP requests and responses are exchanged asynchronously over the
WebSocket connection. A CoAP client can send multiple requests
without waiting for a response and the CoAP server can return
responses in any order. Responses MUST be returned over the same
connection as the originating request. Concurrent requests are
differentiated by their Token, which is scoped locally to the
connection.

The connection is bi-directional, so requests can be sent both by
the entity that established the connection and the remote host.

Retransmission and deduplication of messages is provided by the
WebSocket protocol. CoAP over WebSockets therefore does not make a
distinction between Confirmable or Non-Confirmable messages, and does
not provide Acknowledgement or Reset messages.

## Connection Health {#liveliness}

When a client does not receive any response for some time after
sending a CoAP request (or, similarly, when a client observes a
resource and it does not receive any notification for some time),
the connection between the WebSocket client and the WebSocket
server may be lost or temporarily disrupted without the client
being aware of it.

To check the health of the WebSocket connection (and thereby of all
active requests, if any), a client can send a CoAP Ping Signaling message
({{sec-ping}}). WebSocket Ping and unsolicited Pong frames as
specified in Section 5.5 of {{RFC6455}} SHOULD NOT be used to ensure that
redundant maintenance traffic is not transmitted. 

There is no way to retransmit a request without
creating a new one. Re-registering interest in a resource is
permitted, but entirely unnecessary.

## Closing the Connection {#close}

The WebSocket connection is closed as specified in Section 7 of {{RFC6455}}.

All requests for which the CoAP client has not received
a response yet are cancelled when the connection is closed.

# Signaling

Signaling messages are introduced to allow peers to:

* Related characteristics such as maximum message size for the connection
* Shut down the connection in an orderly fashion
* Provide diagnostic information when terminating a connection in response to a serious error condition

Signaling is a third basic kind of message in CoAP, after requests and responses. 
Signaling messages share a common structure with the existing CoAP messages.
There is a code, a token, options, and an optional payload. 

(See Section 3 of {{-coap}} for the overall structure, as adapted to the
specific transport.)

## Signaling Codes

A code in the 7.00-7.31 range indicates a Signaling message. Values in this
range are assigned by the "CoAP Signaling Codes" sub-registry (see {{message-codes}}).

For each message, there is a sender and a peer receiving the message.

Payloads in Signaling messages are diagnostic payloads as defined in Section
5.5.2 of {{-coap}}), unless otherwise defined by a Signaling
message option.

## Signaling Option Numbers

Option numbers for Signaling messages are specific to the message
code. They do not share the number space with CoAP options for
request/response messages or with Signaling messages using other
codes.

Option numbers are assigned by the "CoAP Signaling Option Numbers"
sub-registry (see {{option-codes}}).

Signaling options are elective or critical as defined in Section 5.4.1
of {{-coap}}. If a Signaling option is critical and not understood by
the receiver, it MUST abort the connection (see {{sec-abort}}). If the
option is understood but cannot be processed, the option documents the behavior.

## Capabilities and Settings Messages (CSM) {#csm}

Capabilities and Settings messages (CSM) are used for two purposes:

* Each capability option advertises one capability of the sender to the recipient. 

* Setting options indicate a setting that will be applied by the sender.

One CSM MUST be sent by both endpoints at the start of the connection. Further
CSM MAY be sent at any other time by either endpoint over the lifetime of
the connection.

Both capability and setting options are cumulative. A CSM does not invalidate a previously sent capability indication or setting
even if it is not repeated. A capability message without any option is a no-operation (and
can be used as such). An option that is sent might override a previous value for
the same option. The option defines how to handle this case if needed.

Base values are listed below for CSM Options. These are the values for the
capability and setting before any Capabilities and Settings messages send a
modified value.

These are not default values for the option as defined in Section 5.4.4 in {{RFC7252}}.
A default value would mean that an empty Capabilities and Settings message would result in
the option being set to its default value. 

Capabilities and Settings messages are indicated by the 7.01 code (CSM).

### Server-Name Setting Option

| Number | Applies to | Name                | Format     | Length      | Base Value  |
|:-------+:-----------+:--------------------+-----------:+------------:+------------:+
|      1 | CSM        | Server-Name         | string     | 1-255       | (see below) |

A client can use the critical Server-Name Option to indicate the default value
for the Uri-Host Options in the messages that it sends to the server.
It has the same restrictions as the Uri-Host Option (Section 5.10.1 of {{RFC7252}}).

For TLS, the base value for the Server-Name Option is given by the SNI value.

For Websockets, the base value for the Server-Name Option is given by the HTTP
Host header field.

### Max-Message-Size Capability Option {#max-message-size}

The sender can use the elective Max-Message-Size Option to indicate the maximum message size
in bytes that it can receive.

| Number | Applies to | Name                | Format     | Length      | Base Value  |
|:-------+:-----------+:--------------------+-----------:+------------:+------------:+
|      2 | CSM        | Max-Message-Size    | uint       | 0-4         | 1152        |

As per Section 4.6 of {{-coap}}, the base value (and the value used when this option
is not implemented) is 1152. 

### Block-wise Transfer Capability Option

| Number | Applies to | Name                | Format     | Length      | Base Value  |
|:-------+:-----------+:--------------------+-----------:+------------:+------------:+
|      4 | CSM        | Block-wise Transfer |  empty     | 0           | (none)      |

A sender can use the elective Block-wise Transfer Option to indicate that it
supports the block-wise transfer protocol {{-block}}.

If the option is not given, the peer has no information about whether block-wise
transfers are supported by the sender or not. An implementation that supports
block-wise transfers SHOULD indicate the Block-wise Transfer Option. If a
Max-Message-Size Option is indicated with a value that is greater than 1152
(in the same or a different CSM message), the Block-wise Transfer Option also
indicates support for BERT (see {{bert}}).

## Ping and Pong Messages {#sec-ping}

In CoAP over TCP, Empty messages (Code 0.00) can always be sent and MUST be ignored
by the recipient. This provides a basic keep-alive function
that can refresh NAT bindings. In contrast, Ping and Pong messages are a bidirectional exchange.

Upon receipt of a Ping message, a single Pong message is returned with the identical
token. As with all Signaling messages, the recipient of a Ping or Pong message MUST
ignore elective options it does not understand.

Ping and Pong messages are indicated by the 7.02 code (Ping) and the 7.03 code (Pong).

### Custody Option

| Number | Applies to | Name                | Format     | Length      | Base Value  |
|:-------+:-----------+:--------------------+-----------:+------------:+------------:+
|      2 | Ping, Pong | Custody             | empty      | 0           | (none)      |

When responding to a Ping message, the receiver can include an elective
Custody Option in the Pong message. This option indicates that the application has
processed all the request/response messages received prior to the Ping message
on the current connection. (Note that there is no definition of specific application
semantics for "processed", but there is an expectation that the receiver of a Pong
Message with a Custody Option should be able to free buffers based on this indication.)

A sender can also include an elective Custody Option in a Ping message to explicitly
request the inclusion of an elective Custody Option in the corresponding Pong message.
The receiver SHOULD delay its Pong message until it finishes processing all the request/response
messages received prior to the Ping message on the current connection.

## Release Messages

A Release message indicates that the sender does not want to continue
maintaining the connection and opts for an orderly shutdown. The details
are in the options. A diagnostic payload (see Section
5.5.2 of {{-coap}}) MAY be included.  A peer will normally
respond to a Release message by closing the TCP/TLS connection. 
Messages may be in flight when the sender decides to send a Release message.
The general expectation is that these will still be processed.

Release messages are indicated by the 7.04 code (Release).

Release messages can indicate one or more reasons using elective options.
The following options are defined:

| Number | Applies to | Name                | Format     | Length      | Base Value  |
|:-------+:-----------+:--------------------+-----------:+------------:+------------:+
|      2 | Release    | Bad-Server-Name     | empty      | 0           | (none)      |

The elective Bad-Server-Name Option indicates that the default indicated
by the CSM Server-Name Option is unlikely to be useful for this server.

| Number | Applies to | Name                | Format     | Length      | Base Value  |
|:-------+:-----------+:--------------------+-----------:+------------:+------------:+
|      4 | Release    | Alternate-Address   | string     | 1-255       | (none)      |

The elective Alternative-Address Option requests the peer to instead open a connection
of the same scheme as the present connection to the alternative transport address given.
Its value is in the form "authority" as defined in Section 3.2 of {{RFC3986}}. 

| Number | Applies to | Name                | Format     | Length      | Base Value  |
|:-------+:-----------+:--------------------+-----------:+------------:+------------:+
|      6 | Release    | Hold-Off            | uint       | 0-3         | (none)      |

The elective Hold-Off Option indicates that the server is requesting that the peer not
reconnect to it for the number of seconds given in the value.

## Abort Messages {#sec-abort}

An Abort message indicates that the sender is unable to continue
maintaining the connection and cannot even wait for an orderly
release. The sender shuts down the connection immediately after
the abort (and may or may not wait for a Release or Abort message or
connection shutdown in the inverse direction). A diagnostic payload
(see Section 5.5.2 of {{-coap}}) SHOULD be included in the Abort message.
Messages may be in flight when the sender decides to send an Abort message.
The general expectation is that these will NOT be processed.

Abort messages are indicated by the 7.05 code (Abort).

Abort messages can indicate one or more reasons using elective
options. The following option is defined:

| Number | Applies to | Name                | Format     | Length      | Base Value  |
|:-------+:-----------+:--------------------+-----------:+------------:+------------:+
|      2 | Abort      | Bad-CSM-Option      | uint       | 0-2         | (none)      |

The elective Bad-CSM-Option Option indicates that the sender is unable to process the
CSM option identified by its option number, e.g. when it is critical
and the option number is unknown by the sender, or when there is
parameter problem with the value of an elective option. More detailed
information SHOULD be included as a diagnostic payload.

One reason for an sender to generate an Abort message is a general
syntax error in the byte-stream received. No specific option has been
defined for this, as the details of that syntax error are best left to
a diagnostic payload.

# Block-wise Transfer and Reliable Transports {#bert}

The message size restrictions defined in Section 4.6 of CoAP {{RFC7252}}
to avoid IP fragmentation are not necessary when CoAP is used over a reliable
transport. While this suggests that the Block-wise transfer protocol
{{-block}} is also no longer needed, it remains applicable for a number of cases:

* large messages, such as firmware downloads, may cause undesired
  head-of-line blocking when a single TCP connection is used

* a UDP-to-TCP gateway may simply not have the context to convert a
  message with a Block Option into the equivalent exchange without any
  use of a Block Option (it would need to convert the entire
  blockwise exchange from start to end into a single exchange)

The 'Block-wise Extension for Reliable Transport (BERT)' extends the
Block protocol to enable the use of larger messages over a reliable
transport.

The use of this new extension is signaled by sending Block1 or
Block2 Options with SZX == 7 (a "BERT option"). SZX == 7 is a 
reserved value in {{-block}}.

In control usage, a BERT option is interpreted in the same way as the
equivalent Option with SZX == 6, except that it also indicates the
capability to process BERT blocks. As with the basic Block protocol,
the recipient of a CoAP request with a BERT option in control usage is
allowed to respond with a different SZX value, e.g. to send a non-BERT
block instead.

In descriptive usage, a BERT Option is interpreted in the same way as
the equivalent Option with SZX == 6, except that the payload is
allowed to contain a multiple of 1024 bytes (non-final BERT block) or
more than 1024 bytes (final BERT block).

The recipient of a non-final BERT block (M=1) conceptually partitions
the payload into a sequence of 1024-byte blocks and acts exactly as
if it had received this sequence in conjunction with block numbers
starting at, and sequentially increasing from, the block number given
in the Block Option. In other words, the entire BERT block is
positioned at the byte position that results from multiplying the
block number with 1024. The position of further blocks to be
transferred is indicated by incrementing the block number by the
number of elements in this sequence (i.e., the size of the payload
divided by 1024 bytes).

As with SZX == 6, the recipient of a final BERT block (M=0) simply
appends the payload at the byte position that is indicated by the
block number multiplied with 1024.

The following examples illustrate BERT options. A value of SZX == 7
is labeled as "BERT" or as "BERT(nnn)" to indicate a payload of size nnn.

In all these examples, a Block Option is decomposed to indicate the
kind of Block Option (1 or 2) followed by a colon, the block number (NUM),
more bit (M), and block size exponent (2**(SZX+4)) separated by slashes.
E.g., a Block2 Option value of 33 would be shown as 2:2/0/32), or a Block1
Option value of 59 would be shown as 1:3/1/128.

## Example: GET with BERT Blocks

{{fig-bert1}} shows a GET request with a response that
is split into three BERT blocks. The first response contains 3072
bytes of payload; the second, 5120; and the third, 4711. Note how
the block number increments to move the position inside the response
body forward.

# CoAP over Reliable Transport URIs {#URI}

CoAP over UDP {{RFC7252}} defines the "coap" and "coaps" URI schemes. This document
introduces four additional URI schemes for identifying CoAP resources and providing a
means of locating the resource:

* the "coap+tcp" URI scheme for CoAP over TCP
* the "coaps+tcp" URI scheme for CoAP over TCP secured by TLS
* the "coap+ws" URI scheme for CoAP over WebSockets
* the "coaps+ws" URI scheme for CoAP over WebSockets secured by TLS

Resources made available via these schemes have no shared identity even if their
resource identifiers indicate the same authority (the same host listening to the same
TCP port). They are distinct namespaces and are considered to be distinct origin servers.

The syntax for the URI schemes in this section are specified using
Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]. The definitions of "host",
"port", "path-abempty", and "query" are adopted from [RFC3986]. 

Section 8 (Multicast CoAP) in {{RFC7252}} is not applicable to these schemes. 

## coap+tcp URI scheme {#coap-tcp-scheme}

The "coap+tcp" URI scheme identifies CoAP resources that are intended to be accessible
using CoAP over TCP.

~~~~
coap+tcp-URI =
   "coap+tcp:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path-abempty [ "?" query ]
~~~~
{: artwork-align="center"}

The syntax defined in Section 6.1 of {{RFC7252}} applies to this URI scheme with the following changes:

* The port subcomponent indicates the TCP port at which the CoAP server is located.
(If it is empty or not given, then the default port 5683 is assumed, as with UDP.)

Encoding considerations:
:	The scheme encoding conforms to the encoding rules established for URIs in [RFC3986]. 

Interoperability considerations:
:	None.

Security considerations:
:	See Section 11.1 of {{RFC7252}}.

## coaps+tcp URI scheme {#coaps-tcp-scheme}

The "coaps+tcp" URI scheme identifies CoAP resources that are intended to be accessible
using CoAP over TCP secured with TLS.

~~~~
coaps+tcp-URI =
   "coaps+tcp:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path-abempty [ "?" query ]
~~~~
{: artwork-align="center"}

The syntax defined in Section 6.2 of {{RFC7252}} applies to this URI scheme, with the following changes:

* The port subcomponent indicates the TCP port at which the TLS server
  for the CoAP server is located. If it is empty or not given, then
  the default port 443 is assumed (this is different from the default
  port for "coaps", i.e., CoAP over DTLS over UDP).

* If a TCP server does not support the Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension (ALPN)
  {{-alpn}} or wishes to accommodate TCP clients that do not support ALPN, it MAY offer a
  coaps+tcp endpoint on TCP port 5684. This endpoint MAY also be ALPN enabled. A TCP server
  MAY offer coaps+tcp endpoints on ports other than TCP port 5684, which MUST be ALPN enabled.

* For TCP ports other than port 5684, the TCP client MUST use the ALPN extension to advertise
  the "coap" protocol identifier (see {{alpnpid}}) in the list of protocols in its
  ClientHello. If the TCP server selects and returns the "coap" protocol identifier using the
  ALPN extension in its ServerHello, then the connection succeeds. If the TCP server either does
  not negotiate the ALPN extension or returns a no_application_protocol alert, the TCP client
  MUST close the connection.

* For TCP port 5684, a TCP client MAY use the ALPN extension to advertise the "coap" protocol
  identifier in the list of protocols in its ClientHello. If the TCP server selects and returns
  the "coap" protocol identifier using the ALPN extension in its ServerHello, then the connection
  succeeds. If the TCP server returns a no_application_protocol alert, then the TCP client MUST close the
  connection. If the TCP server does not negotiate the ALPN extension, then coaps+tcp is implicitly
  selected.

* For TCP port 5684, if the TCP client does not use the ALPN extension to negotiate the protocol,
  then coaps+tcp is implicitly selected.

:	The scheme encoding conforms to the encoding rules established for URIs in [RFC3986]. 

Interoperability considerations:
:	None.

Security considerations:
:	See Section 11.1 of {{RFC7252}}.

## coap+ws URI scheme {#coap-ws-scheme}

The "coap+ws" URI scheme identifies CoAP resources that are intended to be accessible
using CoAP over WebSockets.

~~~~
coap-ws-URI =
   "coap+ws:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path-abempty [ "?" query ]
~~~~

The WebSocket endpoint is identified by a "ws" URI that is composed of the authority
part of the "coap+ws" URI and the well-known path "/.well-known/coap" {{RFC5785}}.
The path and query parts of a "coap+ws" URI identify a resource within the specified
endpoint which can be operated on by the methods defined by CoAP:

# Securing CoAP {#securing}

Security Challenges for the Internet of Things {{SecurityChallenges}} recommends:

> ... it is essential that IoT protocol suites specify a mandatory to implement
> but optional to use security solution. This will ensure security is available
> in all implementations, but configurable to use when not necessary (e.g., in closed environment).
> ... even if those features stretch the capabilities of such devices.

A security solution MUST be implemented to protect CoAP over TCP and MUST
be enabled by default. This document defines the TLS binding, but alternative
solutions at different layers in the protocol stack MAY be used to protect
CoAP over TCP when appropriate. Note that there is ongoing work to support a
data object-based security model for CoAP that is independent of transport
(see {{-oscoap}}).

## TLS binding for CoAP over TCP

The TLS usage guidance in {{RFC7925}} applies.

During the provisioning phase, a CoAP device is provided with the security information
that it needs, including keying materials, access control lists, and authorization servers.
At the end of the provisioning phase, the device will be in one of four security modes:

NoSec:

: TLS is disabled.

PreSharedKey:

: TLS is enabled. The guidance in Section 4.2 of {{RFC7925}} applies.

RawPublicKey:

: TLS is enabled. The guidance in Section 4.3 of {{RFC7925}} applies.

Certificate:

: TLS is enabled. The guidance in Section 4.4 of {{RFC7925}} applies.

The "NoSec" mode is mandatory-to-implement. The system simply sends the packets over normal
TCP which is indicated by the "coap+tcp" scheme and the TCP CoAP default port.
The system is secured only by keeping attackers from being able to send
or receive packets from the network with the CoAP nodes.

"PreSharedKey", "RawPublicKey", or "Certificate" is mandatory-to-implement for the TLS
binding depending on the credential type used with the device. These security modes are
achieved using TLS and are indicated by the "coaps+tcp" scheme and TLS-secured CoAP default port.

# Security Considerations {#security}

The security considerations of {{-coap}} apply. For CoAP over WebSockets and
CoAP over TLS-secured WebSockets, the security considerations of {{RFC6455}}
also apply.

## Signaling Messages

* The guidance given by an Alternative-Address Option cannot be
  followed blindly. In particular, a peer MUST NOT assume that a
  successful connection to the Alternative-Address inherits all the
  security properties of the current connection.
* SNI vs. Server-Name: Any security negotiated in the TLS handshake is
  for the SNI name exchanged in the TLS handshake and checked against
  the certificate provided by the server. The Server-Name Option
  cannot be used to extend these security properties to the additional
  server name.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}


## Signaling Codes {#message-codes}

IANA is requested to create a third sub-registry for values of the Code field in the CoAP
header (Section 12.1 of {{-coap}}). The name of this sub-registry is "CoAP Signaling Codes".

Each entry in the sub-registry must include the Signaling Code in the range
7.00-7.31, its name, and a reference to its documentation. 

Initial entries in this sub-registry are as follows:

| Code | Name    | Reference |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 7.01 | CSM     | [RFCthis] |
| 7.02 | Ping    | [RFCthis] |
| 7.03 | Pong    | [RFCthis] |
| 7.04 | Release | [RFCthis] |
| 7.05 | Abort   | [RFCthis] |
{: #signal-codes title="CoAP Signal Codes" }

All other Signaling Codes are Unassigned.

The IANA policy for future additions to this sub-registry is "IETF
Review or IESG Approval" as described in {{RFC5226}}.

## CoAP Signaling Option Numbers Registry {#option-codes}

IANA is requested to create a sub-registry for Options Numbers used
in CoAP signaling options within the "CoRE Parameters" registry.
The name of this sub-registry is "CoAP Signaling Option Numbers".

Each entry in the sub-registry must include one or more of the codes
in the Signaling Codes subregistry ({{message-codes}}), the option
number, the name of the option, and a reference to the option's 
documentation.  

Initial entries in this sub-registry are as follows:

| Applies to | Number | Name                | Reference |
|------------|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| 7.01       |      1 | Server-Name         | [RFCthis] |
| 7.01       |      2 | Max-Message-Size    | [RFCthis] |
| 7.01       |      4 | Block-wise-Transfer | [RFCthis] |
| 7.02, 7.03 |      2 | Custody             | [RFCthis] |
| 7.04       |      2 | Bad-Server-Name     | [RFCthis] |
| 7.04       |      4 | Alternative-Address | [RFCthis] |
| 7.04       |      6 | Hold-Off            | [RFCthis] |
| 7.05       |      2 | Bad-CSM-Option      | [RFCthis] |
{: #signal-option-codes title="CoAP Signal Option Codes" cols="l r l c"}

The IANA policy for future additions to this sub-registry is based on
number ranges for the option numbers, analogous to the policy defined
in Section 12.2 of {{-coap}}.

# Updates to RFC7641 Observing Resources in the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) {#observing}

## Notifications and Reordering

When using the Observe Option with CoAP over UDP, notifications from the server set the option
value to an increasing sequence number for reordering detection on the client since messages
can arrive in a different order than they were sent. This sequence number is not required
for CoAP over reliable transports since the TCP protocol ensures reliable and ordered delivery
of messages. The value of the Observe Option in 2.xx notifications MAY be empty on transmission
and MUST be ignored on reception.

## Transmission and Acknowledgements

For CoAP over UDP, server notifications to the client can be confirmable or non-confirmable.
A confirmable message requires the client to either respond with an acknowledgement message or
a reset message. An acknowledgement message indicates that the client is alive and wishes to receive
further notifications. A reset message indicates that the client does not recognize
the token which causes the server to remove the associated entry from the list of observers.

Since TCP eliminates the need for the message layer to support reliability, CoAP over reliable
transports does not support confirmable or non-confirmable message types. All notifications are
delivered reliably to the client with positive acknowledgement of receipt occurring at the TCP
level. If the client does not recognize the token in a notification, it MAY immediately abort
the connection (see {{sec-abort}}).

## Cancellation

For CoAP over UDP, a client that is no longer interested in receiving notifications can "forget"
the observation and respond to the next notification from the server with a reset message to cancel
the observation. 

For CoAP over reliable transports, a client MUST explicitly deregister by issuing a GET request
that has the Token field set to the token of the observation to be cancelled and includes an Observe
Option with the value set to 1 (deregister). 

If the client observes one or more resources over a reliable transport, then the CoAP server
(or intermediary in the role of the CoAP server) MUST remove all entries associated with the
client endpoint from the lists of observers when the connection is either closed or times out.

# CoAP over WebSocket Examples {#examples}

This section gives examples for the first two configurations
discussed in {{websockets-overview}}.

An example of the process followed by a CoAP client to retrieve the
representation of a resource identified by a "coap+ws" URI might be as
follows. {{example-1}} below illustrates the WebSocket and
CoAP messages exchanged in detail.

1. The CoAP client obtains the URI
  \<coap+ws://example.org/sensors/temperature?u=Cel>,
  for example, from a resource representation that it retrieved
  previously.

1. It establishes a WebSocket connection to the endpoint URI composed
  of the authority "example.org" and the well-known path
  "/.well-known/coap", \<ws://example.org/.well-known/coap>.

1. It sends a single-frame, masked, binary message containing a CoAP
  request. The request indicates the target resource with the
  Uri-Path ("sensors", "temperature") and Uri-Query ("u=Cel")
  options.

1. It waits for the server to return a response.

1. The CoAP client uses the connection for further requests, or the
  connection is closed.

{: #example-1 title='A CoAP client retrieves the representation of a resource identified by a "coap+ws" URI'}

{{example-2}} shows how a CoAP client uses a CoAP
forward proxy with a WebSocket endpoint to retrieve the representation
of the resource "coap://[2001:DB8::1]/". The use of the forward
proxy and the address of the WebSocket endpoint are determined by the
client from local configuration rules. The request URI is specified
in the Proxy-Uri Option. Since the request URI uses the "coap" URI
scheme, the proxy fulfills the request by issuing a Confirmable GET
request over UDP to the CoAP server and returning the response over
the WebSocket connection to the client.
