--- abstract

The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), although inspired by HTTP, was designed to use UDP
instead of TCP.  The message layer of the CoAP over UDP protocol includes support for
reliable delivery, simple congestion control, and flow control.

Some environments benefit from the availability to convey CoAP over reliable
transports, such as TCP and TLS.  This document
outlines the changes required to use CoAP over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets.

# Introduction {#introduction}

The [Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)](#RFC7252) was designed
for Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, assuming that UDP {{RFC0768}} 
or DTLS {{RFC6347}} over UDP can be used unimpeded. UDP is a good choice
for transferring small amounts of data across networks that follow the IP
architecture.

Some CoAP deployments need to integrate well with existing enterprise
infrastructures, where UDP-based protocols may not be well-received or may
even be blocked by firewalls. Middleboxes that are unaware of CoAP usage for
IoT can make the use of UDP brittle, resulting in lost or malformed packets.

To address such environments, this document defines how to carry CoAP over TCP, 
CoAP over TLS, and CoAP over WebSockets. {{layering}} shows this layering 
in a simplified version (without considering the additional signaling protocols 
used by CoAP over TCP/TLS (as described in {{signaling}}) and used by CoAP over 
Websockets (as described in {{websockets-overview}}).

Where NATs are present, CoAP over TCP can help with their traversal.
NATs often calculate expiration timers based on the transport layer protocol
being used by application protocols. Many NATs maintain TCP-based NAT bindings
for longer periods based on the assumption that a transport layer protocol, such
as TCP, offers additional information about the session life cycle. UDP, on the other
hand, does not provide such information to a NAT and timeouts tend to be much 
shorter {{HomeGateway}}.

Some environments may also benefit from the ability of TCP to exchange
larger payloads, such as firmware images, without application layer
fragmentation and to utilize the more sophisticated congestion control
capabilities provided by many TCP implementations.

CoAP may be integrated into a Web environment where the front-end
uses CoAP over UDP from IoT devices to a cloud infrastructure and then CoAP
over TCP between the back-end services. A TCP-to-UDP gateway can be used at
the cloud boundary to communicate with the UDP-based IoT device.

To allow IoT devices to better communicate in these demanding environments, CoAP
needs to support different transport protocols, namely TCP {{RFC0793}},
in some situations secured by TLS {{RFC5246}}.

In addition, some corporate networks only allow Internet access via a HTTP proxy.
In this case, the best transport for CoAP would be the [WebSocket Protocol](#RFC6455).
The WebSocket protocol provides two-way communication between a client
and a server after upgrading an [HTTP/1.1](#RFC7230) connection and may
be available in an environment that blocks CoAP over UDP. Another scenario
for CoAP over WebSockets is a CoAP application running inside a web browser
without access to connectivity other than HTTP and WebSockets.

This document specifies how to access resources using CoAP requests
and responses over the TCP/TLS and WebSocket protocols. This allows
connectivity-limited applications to obtain end-to-end CoAP
connectivity either by communicating CoAP directly with a CoAP server
accessible over a TCP/TLS or WebSocket Connection or via a CoAP intermediary
that proxies CoAP requests and responses between different transports,
such as between WebSockets and UDP.

# CoAP over TCP

# Architecture 

The request/response interaction model of CoAP TCP/TLS is similar to CoAP UDP
and the primary differences are in the message layer. CoAP UDP supports optional
reliability by defining four types of messages: Confirmable, Non-confirmable,
Acknowledgement, and Reset. TCP eliminates the need for the message layer
to support reliability and in-order message delivery. 
As a result, message types are not defined in CoAP TCP/TLS.

## Messaging Model 

Conceptually, CoAP TCP/TLS replaces most of the CoAP UDP message layer
with a framing mechanism on top of the byte stream provided by TCP/TLS,
conveying the length information for each message that on datagram transports
is provided by the UDP/DTLS datagram layer.

With CoAP over TCP both the Type and Message ID fields are no longer required
and are removed from the CoAP over TCP message format. All messages are also untyped.

{{fig-flow-comparison}} illustrates the difference between CoAP over UDP and CoAP over reliable transport. 
The removed Type (no type) and Message ID fields are indicated by dashes.

## UDP-to-TCP gateways

A UDP-to-TCP gateway MUST discard all Empty messages after processing at the
message layer. For Confirmable (CON), Non-Confirmable (NOM), and Acknowledgement
(ACK) messages that are not Empty, their contents are repackaged into untyped
messages.

## Shim Header {#shim-header}

The CoAP message format defined in {{RFC7252}}, as shown in 
{{CoAP-Header}}, relies on the datagram transport (UDP, or DTLS over
UDP) for keeping the individual messages separate and for providing 
length information.

{: #CoAP-Header title='RFC 7252 defined CoAP Message Format.'}

The CoAP over TCP/TLS message format is very similar to the format
specified for CoAP over UDP. The differences are as follows:

* Since the underlying TCP connection provides retransmissions and
  deduplication, there is no need for the reliability mechanisms
  provided by CoAP over UDP. The "T" and "Message ID" fields in
  the CoAP message header are elided.

* The "Ver" field is elided as well. In constrast to the UDP message
  layer for UDP and DTLS, the CoAP over TCP message layer does not
  send a version number in each message. If required in the future,
  a new Capability and Settings option (See {{negotiation}}) could be
  defined to support version negotiation.

* In a stream oriented transport protocol such as TCP, a form of message 
  delimitation is needed.  For this purpose, CoAP over TCP introduces a 
  length field with variable size. {{fig-shim}} shows the adjusted CoAP 
  header format with a modified structure for the fixed header (first 4
  bytes of the UDP CoAP header), which includes the length information of
  variable size, shown here as an 8-bit length.

Len:
: 4-bit unsigned integer. A value between 0 and 12 directly indicates the
  length of the message in bytes starting with the first bit of the Options
  field. Three values are reserved for special constructs:

    13:
    : An 8-bit unsigned integer follows the initial byte and indicates
      the length of options/payload minus 13.

    14:
    : A 16-bit unsigned integer in network byte order follows the
      initial byte and indicates the length of options/payload minus
      269.

    15:
    : A 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order follows the
      initial byte and indicates the length of options/payload minus
      65805.

The encoding of the Len field is modeled on CoAP Options
(see section 3.1 of {{RFC7252}}). 

The following figures show the shim headers for the 0-bit, 16-bit, and 
the 32-bit headers.

The semantics of the other CoAP header fields are left unchanged.

## Message Transmission

CoAP requests and responses are exchanged asynchronously over the
TCP/TLS connection. A CoAP client can send multiple requests
without waiting for a response and the CoAP server can return
responses in any order. Responses MUST be returned over the same
connection as the originating request. Concurrent requests are
differentiated by their Token, which is scoped locally to the
connection.

The connection is bi-directional, so requests can be sent both by
the entity that established the connection and the remote host.

Retransmission and deduplication of messages is provided by the
TCP/TLS protocol. 

Since the TCP protocol provides ordered delivery of messages,
the mechanism for reordering detection when [observing resources](#RFC7641)
is not needed. The value of the Observe Option in notifications MAY be
empty on transmission and MUST be ignored on reception.


# CoAP over WebSockets {#websockets-overview}

CoAP over WebSockets can be used in a number of configurations. The
most basic configuration is a CoAP client seeking to retrieve or
update a CoAP resource located at a CoAP server that exposes a
WebSocket endpoint ({{arch-1}}). The CoAP client takes
the role of the WebSocket client, establishes a WebSocket Connection
and sends a CoAP request, to which the CoAP server returns a CoAP
response. The WebSocket Connection can be used for any number of
requests.

~~~~
{: #arch-1 title='CoAP Client (WebSocket client) accesses CoAP Server (WebSocket server)' artwork-align="center" }

The challenge in this configuration is to identify resource in the
namespace of the CoAP server:
When the WebSocket Protocol is used by a dedicated client directly
(i.e., not from a web page through a web browser), the client can
connect to any WebSocket endpoint. This means it is necessary that
the client is able to determine both the WebSocket endpoint (identified
by a "ws" or "wss" URI) and the path and query of the CoAP resource within
that endpoint from the same URI. When the WebSocket Protocol is used
from a web page, the choices are more limited {{RFC6454}}, but the challenge persists.

{{uris}} proposes a new "coap+ws" URI scheme that
identifies both a WebSocket endpoint and a resource within that
endpoint as follows:

~~~~
      coap+ws://example.org/sensors/temperature?u=Cel
           \______  ______/\___________  ___________/
                  \/                   \/
                                     Uri-Path: "sensors"
ws://example.org/.well-known/coap    Uri-Path: "temperature"
                                     Uri-Query: "u=Cel"
~~~~
{: #uri-example title='The "coap+ws" URI Scheme' artwork-align="center" }

Another possible configuration is to set up a CoAP forward proxy
at the WebSocket endpoint. Depending on what transports are available
to the proxy, it could forward the request to a CoAP server with a
CoAP UDP endpoint ({{arch-2}}), an SMS endpoint
(a.k.a.&nbsp;mobile phone), or even another WebSocket endpoint. The
client specifies the resource to be updated or retrieved in the
Proxy-URI Option.

A third possible configuration
is a CoAP server running inside a web browser
({{arch-3}}). The web browser initially connects to a
WebSocket endpoint and is then reachable through the WebSocket
server. When no connection exists, the CoAP server is not reachable.
Because the WebSocket server is the only way to reach the CoAP
server, the CoAP proxy should be a Reverse Proxy.

Further configurations are possible, including those where a
WebSocket Connection is established through an HTTP proxy.

CoAP over WebSockets is intentionally very similar to CoAP as defined
over UDP. Therefore, instead of presenting CoAP over WebSockets as a
new protocol, this document specifies it as a series of deltas from
{{RFC7252}}.

## Opening Handshake {#handshake}

Before CoAP requests and responses can be exchanged, a WebSocket
Connection needs to be established as defined in Section 4 of
{{RFC6455}}. {{handshake-example}} shows an example.

The WebSocket client MUST include the subprotocol name "coap" in
the list of protocols, which indicates support for the protocol
defined in this document. Any later, incompatible versions of
CoAP or CoAP over WebSockets will use a different subprotocol
name.

The WebSocket client includes the hostname of the WebSocket server
in the Host header field of its handshake as per {{RFC6455}}. The Host
header field also indicates the default
value of the Uri-Host Option in requests from the WebSocket client
to the WebSocket server.

## Message Format {#websocket-message-format}

Once a WebSocket Connection has been established, CoAP requests and
responses can be exchanged as WebSocket messages. Since CoAP uses a
binary message format, the messages are transmitted in binary data
frames as specified in Sections 5 and 6 of {{RFC6455}}.

The message format is very similar to the format specified for
[CoAP over UDP](#RFC7252). The differences are as follows:

* Since the underlying TCP connection provides retransmissions and
  deduplication, there is no need for the reliability mechanisms
  provided by CoAP over UDP. The "T" and "Message ID" fields in
  the CoAP message header are elided.

* Furthermore, since the CoAP version is negotiated during
  the opening handshake, the "Ver" field is elided as well.

{: #ws-message-format title='CoAP Message Format over WebSockets' artwork-align="center"}

The resulting message format is shown in {{ws-message-format}}. The
four most-significant bits of the first byte are reserved (R) and MUST
be set to zero. The remaining fields and structure are the same as defined
in {{RFC7252}}.

Requests and response messages can be fragmented as specified in
Section 5.4 of {{RFC6455}}, though typically they are
sent unfragmented as they tend to be small and fully buffered before
transmission. The WebSocket protocol does not provide
means for multiplexing; if it is not desirable for a large message to
monopolize the connection, requests and responses can be transferred in a
blockwise fashion as defined in {{I-D.ietf-core-block}}.

Messages MUST NOT be Empty (Code 0.00), i.e., messages always carry
either a request or a response.


## Message Transmission {#requests-responses}

CoAP requests and responses are exchanged asynchronously over the
WebSocket Connection, i.e., a CoAP client can send multiple requests
without waiting for a response and the CoAP server can return
responses in any order. Responses MUST be returned over the same
connection as the originating request. Concurrent requests are
differentiated by their Token, which is scoped locally to the
connection.

The connection is bi-directional, so requests can be sent both by
the entity that established the connection and the remote host.

Retransmission and deduplication of messages is provided by the
WebSocket Protocol. CoAP over WebSockets therefore does not make a
distinction between Confirmable or Non-Confirmable messages, and does
not provide Acknowledgement or Reset messages.

Since the WebSocket Protocol provides ordered delivery of messages,
the mechanism for reordering detection when
[observing resources](#RFC7641) is not needed. The value of the
Observe Option in notifications therefore MAY be empty on transmission
and MUST be ignored on reception.

## Connection Health {#liveliness}

When a client does not receive any response for some time after
sending a CoAP request (or, similarly, when a client observes a
resource and it does not receive any notification for some time),
the connection between the WebSocket client and the WebSocket
server may be lost or temporarily disrupted without the client
being aware of it.

To check the health of the WebSocket Connection (and thereby of all
active requests, if any), the client can send a Ping frame or an
unsolicited Pong frame as specified in Section 5.5 of
{{RFC6455}}. There is no way to retransmit a request without
creating a new one. Re-registering interest in a resource is
permitted, but entirely unnecessary.

## Closing the Connection {#close}

The WebSocket Connection is closed as specified in Section 7 of {{RFC6455}}.

All requests for which the CoAP client has not received
a response yet are cancelled when the connection is closed.
If the client observes one or more resources over the WebSocket
Connection, then the CoAP server (or intermediary in the role of
the CoAP server) MUST remove all entries associated with the client
from the lists of observers when the connection is closed.

# Signaling {#signaling}

The underlying reliable protocols have methods to configure connection
properties and manage the connection. In many cases, these methods are
inadequate for managing CoAP's use of the connection.

Signaling messages are introduced to signal information about the connection.
They define a third basic kind of messages in CoAP, after requests and responses. 

Signaling messages share a common structure with the existing CoAP messages.
There is a code, a token, options, and an optional payload. 

(See Section 3 of {{-coap}} for the overall structure, as adapted to the
specific transport.)

## Signaling Codes

A code in the 7.01-7.31 range indicates a Signaling message. Values in this
range are assigned by the "CoAP Signaling Codes" sub-registry (see {{message-codes}}).

For each message, there is a sender and a peer receiving the message.

Payloads in Signaling messages are diagnostic payloads (see Section
5.5.2 of {{-coap}}), unless otherwise defined by a Signaling
message option.

## Signaling Option Numbers

Option numbers for Signaling messages are specific to the message
code. They do not share the number space with CoAP options for
request/response messages or with Signaling messages using other
codes.

Option numbers are assigned by the "CoAP Signaling Option Numbers"
sub-registry (see {{option-codes}}).

Signaling options are elective or critical as defined in Section 5.4.1
of {{-coap}}). If a Signaling option is critical and not understood by
the receiver, it MUST abort the connection (see {{sec-abort}}). If the
option is understood but cannot be processed, the option documents the behavior.

## Capability and Settings Messages (CSM)

Capability and Settings messages are used for two purposes:

* Capability options advertise a capability from the sender to the recipient.

* Setting options indicate a setting that will be applied by the sender.

Both capability options and setting options are cumulative,
i.e., a capability message without any option is a no-operation (and
can be used as such). An option that is given might override a
previous value for the same option; the option defines how to handle
this, if needed. Most CSM options are useful mainly as initial
messages in the connection.

Capability and Settings messages are indicated by the 7.01 code (CSM).

### Server-Name Setting Option

A client can indicate a default value that it wants to set for the
Uri-Host options in the messages it sends to the server:

The Server-Name option is defined as follows:

| Option Number | Applies to | Option Name | Reference |
|---------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
|             1 | CSM        | Server-Name | [RFCthis] |

Server-Name is a critical option and carries a "string" value, with the same restrictions as Uri-Host (Section
5.10 of {{RFC7252}}: length is between 1 and 255).

For TLS, the initial value for the Server-Name option is given by the SNI value.

For Websockets, the initial value for the Server-Name is given by the HTTP Host header field.


### Max-Message-Size Capability Indication Option

A sender can indicate a maximum message size that it can receive.

The Max-Message-Size option is defined as follows:

| Option Number | Applies to | Option Name      | Reference |
|---------------|------------|------------------|-----------|
|             2 | CSM        | Max-Message-Size | [RFCthis] |

Max-Message-Size is an elective option with a "uint" value,
indicating the message size in bytes.  As per Section 4.6 of {{-coap}},
the default value (and the value used when this option is not implemented)
is 1152.  (Note that a peer implementation that relies on this option being
indicated and having a certain minimum value will enjoy only limited interoperability.)

### Block-wise Transfer Capability Option

A sender can indicate that it supports the block-wise transfer
protocol defined in {{-block}}.

The Block-wise-Transfer option is defined as follows:

| Option Number | Applies to | Option Name         | Reference |
|---------------+------------+---------------------+-----------|
|             4 | CSM        | Block-wise-Transfer | [RFCthis] |

Block-wise-Transfer is an elective option with an empty value.
If the option is not given, the peer has no information about whether
block-wise transfers are supported by the sender or not. An implementation
that supports block-wise transfers SHOULD indicate the Block-Wise Transfer option.
If a Max-Message-Size option is indicated with a value that is greater than 1152
(in the same or a different CSM message), the Block-Wise Transfer option
also indicates support for BERT.

## Protocol Version Negotiation {#negotiation}

CoAP is defined in {{RFC7252}} with a version number of 1.  In contrast
to the message layer for UDP and DTLS, the CoAP over TCP message layer
does not send the version number in each single message.  Instead,
options for the Capability and Settings message can be used to perform
a version negotiation.

At the time of writing, there is no known reason for supporting
version numbers different from 1.  The details of a version
negotiation, once it is actually needed, will depend on the specifics
of the new version(s), so the present specification makes no attempt
to specify these details.  However, Capability and Settings messages
have been specifically designed with a view to supporting such a
potential future need.

## Ping and Pong Messages

In CoAP over TCP/TLS, Empty messages can always be sent and will be ignored. This provides
a basic keep-alive function that can refresh NAT bindings. In contrast,
Ping and Pong messages are a bidirectional exchange.

A Ping message is responded to by a single Pong message with the same token.
As with all Signaling messages, the recipient of a Ping or Pong message MUST
ignore elective options it does not understand.

Ping and Pong messages are indicated by the 7.02 code (Ping) and the 7.03 code (Pong).

### Custody Option

A peer replying to a Ping message can add a Custody Option to the Pong
message it returns. This option indicates that the application has
processed all request/response messages that it has received in the
present connection ahead of the Ping message that prompted the Pong
message. (Note that there is no definition of specific application
semantics of "processed", but there is an expectation that the sender
of the Ping leading to the Pong with a Custody Option should be able
to free buffers based on this indication.)

A Custody Option can also be sent in a Ping message to explicitly
request the return of a Custody Option in the Pong message. A peer
is always free to indicate that it has finished processing
all previous request/response messages by sending a Custody Option
(which is therefore elective) in a Pong message. A peer is also free
NOT to send a Custody Option in case it is still processing previous
request/response messages; however, it SHOULD delay its response to a
Ping with a Custody Option until it also can return one.

| Option Number | Applies to | Option Name | Reference |
|---------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
|             2 | Ping, Pong | Custody     | [RFCthis] |

The Custody option is an elective option with an empty value.

## Release Messages

A release message indicates that the sender does not want to continue
maintaining the connection and opts for an orderly shutdown; the details
are in the options. A diagnostic payload MAY be included. A release message
will normally be replied to by the peer by closing the TCP/TLS connection.
Messages may be in flight when the sender decides to send a Release message.
The general expectation is that these will still be processed.

Release messages are indicated by the 7.04 code (Release).

Release messages can indicate one or more reasons using elective
options. The following options are defined:

| Option Number | Applies to | Option Name         | Reference |
|---------------|------------|---------------------|-----------|
|             2 | Release    | Bad-Server-Name     | [RFCthis] |
|             4 | Release    | Alternative-Address | [RFCthis] |
|             6 | Release    | Hold-Off            | [RFCthis] |

Bad-Server-Name indicates that the default as set by the CSM
option Server-Name is unlikely to be useful for this server.  It has
an empty value.

Alternative-Address requests the peer to instead open a
connection of the same kind as the present connection to the
alternative transport address given.  The value is a string of the
form "authority" as defined in Section 3.2 of {{RFC3986}}. 

Hold-Off indicates that the server is requesting that the peer not
reconnect to it for the number of seconds given in the "uint" value.

## Abort Messages {#sec-abort}

An abort message indicates that the sender is unable to continue
maintaining the connection and cannot even wait for an orderly
release. The sender shuts down the connection immediately after
the abort (and may or may not wait for a release or abort message or
connection shutdown in the inverse direction). A diagnostic payload
SHOULD be included in the Abort message. Messages may be in flight
when the sender decides to send an abort message; the general
expectation is that these will NOT be processed.

Abort messages are indicated by the 7.05 code (Abort).

Abort messages can indicate one or more reasons using elective
options. The following option is defined:

| Option Number | Applies to | Option Name    | Reference |
|---------------|------------|----------------|-----------|
|             2 | Abort      | Bad-CSM-Option | [RFCthis] |

Bad-CSM-Option indicates that the sender is unable to process the
CSM option identified by its option number, e.g. when it is critical
and the option number is unknown by the sender, or when there is
parameter problem with the value of an elective option.  The value is
a "uint".  More detailed information SHOULD be included as a diagnostic payload.

One reason for an sender to generate an abort message is a general
syntax error in the byte stream received. No specific option has been
defined for this, as the details of that syntax error are best left to
a diagnostic payload.


# Reliable Transports and Block-Wise Transfer

CoAP {{RFC7252}} restricts the maximum payload size that can be transferred 
over UDP since length information is incoded in the UDP header. To transfer
large payloads, such as firmware images, the blockwise transfer protocol 
has been designed {{-block}}.
 
CoAP when transferred over TCP (using the extended length information encoded in the 
shim header) is not restricted in the same way anymore and this appears to 
obviate the need for the block-wise transfer protocol {{-block}}. However, 
entirely getting rid of it is not a generally applicable solution, as:

* large messages, such as firmware downloads, may cause undesired
  head-of-line blocking when a single TCP connection is used, and

* a UDP-to-TCP gateway may simply not have the context to convert a
  message with a Block option into the equivalent exchange without any
  use of a Block option.

The 'Block-Wise Extension for Reliable Transport (BERT)' extends the
Block protocol to enable the use of larger messages over a reliable
transport.

The use of this new extension is signalled by sending Block1 or
Block2 options with SZX == 7 (a "BERT option"). SZX == 7 is a 
reserved value in {{-block}}.

In control usage, a BERT option is interpreted in the same way as the
equivalent option with SZX == 6, except that it also indicates the
capability to process BERT blocks.  As with the basic Block protocol,
the recipient of a CoAP request with a BERT option in control usage is
allowed to respond with a different SZX value, e.g. to send a non-BERT
block instead.

In descriptive usage, a BERT option is interpreted in the same way as
the equivalent option with SZX == 6, except that the payload is
allowed to contain a multiple of 1024 bytes (non-final BERT block) or
more than 1024 bytes (final BERT block).

The recipient of a non-final BERT block (M=1) conceptually partitions
the payload into a sequence of 1024-byte blocks and acts exactly as
if it had received this sequence in conjunction with block numbers
starting at, and sequentially increasing from, the block number given
in the Block option.  In other words, the entire BERT block is
positioned at the byte position that results from multiplying the
block number with 1024.  The position of further blocks to be
transferred is indicated by incrementing the block number by the
number of elements in this sequence (i.e., the size of the payload
divided by 1024 bytes).

As with SZX == 6, the recipient of a final BERT block (M=0) simply
appends the payload at the byte position that is indicated by the
block number multiplied with 1024.

The following examples illustrate BERT options.  A value of SZX == 7
is labeled as "BERT" or as "BERT(nnn)" to indicate a payload of size nnn.

In all these examples, a Block option is decomposed to indicate the
kind of Block option (1 or 2) followed by a colon, the block number (NUM),
more bit (M), and block size exponent (2**(SZX+4)) separated by slashes.
E.g., a Block2 Option value of 33 would be shown as 2:2/0/32), or a Block1
Option value of 59 would be shown as 1:3/1/128.

## Example: GET with BERT Blocks

{{fig-bert1}} shows a GET request with a response that
is split into three BERT blocks.  The first response contains 3072
bytes of payload; the second, 5120; and the third, 4711.  Note how
the block number increments to move the position inside the response
body forward.

# CoAP URIs {#URI}

CoAP over UDP {{RFC7252}} defines the "coap" and "coaps" URI schemes for
identifying CoAP resources and providing a means of locating the resource. 

## CoAP over TCP and TLS URIs

CoAP over TCP uses the "coap+tcp" URI scheme. CoAP over TLS uses the "coaps+tcp"
scheme. The rules from Section 6 of {{RFC7252}} apply to both of these URI schemes.

{{RFC7252}}, Section 8 (Multicast CoAP) is not applicable to these schemes.

Resources made available via one of the "coap+tcp" or "coaps+tcp" schemes
have no shared identity with the other scheme or with the "coap" or
"coaps" scheme, even if their resource identifiers indicate the
same authority (the same host listening to the same port).
The schemes constitute distinct namespaces and, in combination with
the authority, are considered to be distinct
origin servers.

### coap+tcp URI scheme

~~~~
coap-tcp-URI = "coap+tcp:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path-abempty
               [ "?" query ]
~~~~

The semantics defined in {{RFC7252}}, Section 6.1, apply to this
URI scheme, with the following changes:

* The port subcomponent indicates the TCP port
at which the CoAP server is located.  (If it is empty or not given,
then the default port 5683 is assumed, as with UDP.)

### coaps+tcp URI scheme {#coapstcp-uri-scheme}

~~~~
coaps-tcp-URI = "coaps+tcp:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path-abempty
                [ "?" query ]
~~~~

The semantics defined in {{RFC7252}}, Section 6.2, apply to this
URI scheme, with the following changes:

* The port subcomponent indicates the TCP port at which the TLS server
  for the CoAP server is located.  If it is empty or not given, then
  the default port 443 is assumed (this is different from the default
  port for "coaps", i.e., CoAP over DTLS over UDP).

* When CoAP is exchanged over TLS port 443, the "TLS Application
  Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension" {{-alpn}} MUST be used to allow 
  demultiplexing at the server-side.

## CoAP over WebSockets URIs {#uris}

For the first configuration discussed in {{websockets-overview}},
this document defines two new URIs schemes that can be used for
identifying CoAP resources and providing a means of locating these
resources: "coap+ws" and "coap+wss".

Similar to the "coap" and "coaps" schemes, the "coap+ws" and
"coap+wss" schemes organize resources hierarchically under a CoAP
origin server. The key difference is that the server is potentially
reachable on a WebSocket endpoint instead of a UDP endpoint.

The WebSocket endpoint is identified by a "ws" or "wss" URI
that is composed of the authority part of the "coap+ws" or
"coap+wss" URI, respectively, and the well-known path
"/.well-known/coap" {{RFC5785}}.
The path and query parts of a "coap+ws" or "coap+wss" URI
identify a resource within the specified endpoint which can be
operated on by the methods defined by the CoAP protocol.

The syntax of the "coap+ws" and "coap+wss" URI schemes is specified
below in Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) {{RFC5234}}.
The definitions of "host", "port", "path-abempty" and "query" are the
same as in {{RFC3986}}.


~~~~
coap-ws-URI =
   "coap+ws:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path-abempty [ "?" query ]

coap-wss-URI =
   "coap+wss:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path-abempty [ "?" query ]
~~~~
{: artwork-align="center"}

The port component is OPTIONAL; the default for "coap+ws" is port
80, while the default for "coap+wss" is port 443.

Fragment identifiers are not part of the request URI and thus MUST
NOT be transmitted in a WebSocket handshake or in the URI options
of a CoAP request.

### Decomposing and Composing URIs

The steps for decomposing a "coap+ws" or "coap+wss" URI into
CoAP options are the same as specified in Section 6.4 of {{RFC7252}}
with the following changes:

* The \<scheme> component MUST be "coap+ws" or "coap+wss"
  when converted to ASCII lowercase.

* A Uri-Host Option MUST only be included in a request when
  the \<host> component does not equal the uri-host
  component in the Host header field in the WebSocket
  handshake.

* A Uri-Port Option MUST only be included in a request if
  \|port\| does not equal the port component in the Host header
  field in the WebSocket handshake.

The steps to construct a URI from a request's options are
changed accordingly.

# Security Considerations {#security}

The security considerations of {{-coap}} apply.

Implementations of CoAP MUST use TLS version 1.2 or higher for CoAP over TLS.
The general TLS usage guidance in {{RFC7525}} SHOULD be followed.

Guidelines for use of cipher suites and TLS extensions can be found in {{I-D.ietf-dice-profile}}.

TLS does not protect the TCP header. This may, for example, 
allow an on-path adversary to terminate a TCP connection prematurely 
by spoofing a TCP reset message.

CoAP over WebSockets and CoAP over TLS-secured WebSockets do not
introduce additional security issues beyond CoAP and DTLS-secured CoAP
respectively {{RFC7252}}. The security considerations of {{RFC6455}} apply.

## Signaling Messages

* The guidance given by an Alternative-Address option cannot be
  followed blindly.  In particular, a peer MUST NOT assume that a
  successful connection to the Alternative-Address inherits all the
  security properties of the current connection.
* SNI vs. Server-Name: Any security negotiated in the TLS handshake is
  for the SNI name exchanged in the TLS handshake and checked against
  the certificate provided by the server.  The Server-Name option
  cannot be used to extend these security properties to the additional
  server name.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}


## Signaling Codes {#message-codes}

IANA is requested to create a third sub-registry for values of the Code field in the CoAP
header (Section 12.1 of {{-coap}}). The name of this sub-registry is "CoAP Signaling Codes".

Each entry in the sub-registry must include the Signaling Code in the range
7.01-7.31, its name, and a reference to its documentation. 

Initial entries in this sub-registry are as follows:

| Code | Name    | Reference |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 7.01 | CSM     | [RFCthis] |
| 7.02 | Ping    | [RFCthis] |
| 7.03 | Pong    | [RFCthis] |
| 7.04 | Release | [RFCthis] |
| 7.05 | Abort   | [RFCthis] |
{: #signal-codes title="CoAP Signal Codes" }

All other Signaling Codes are Unassigned.

The IANA policy for future additions to this sub-registry is "IETF
Review or IESG Approval" as described in {{RFC5226}}.

## CoAP Signaling Option Numbers Registry {#option-codes}

IANA is requested to create a sub-registry for signaling options similar
to the CoAP Option Numbers Registry (Section 12.2 of {{-coap}}), with
the single change that a fourth column is added to the sub-registry
that is one of the codes in the Signaling Codes subregistry ({{message-codes}}).

The name of this sub-registry is "CoAP Signaling Option Numbers".

Initial entries in this sub-registry are as follows:

| Number | Applies to | Name                | Reference |
|--------|------------|---------------------|-----------|
|      1 | CSM        | Server-Name         | [RFCthis] |
|	   2 | CSM        | Max-Message-Size    | [RFCthis] |
|      4 | CSM        | Block-wise-Transfer | [RFCthis] |
|      2 | Ping, Pong | Custody             | [RFCthis] |
|      2 | Release    | Bad-Server-Name     | [RFCthis] |
|      4 | Release    | Alternative-Address | [RFCthis] |
|      6 | Release    | Hold-Off            | [RFCthis] |
|      2 | Abort      | Bad-CSM-Option      | [RFCthis] |
{: #signal-option-codes title="CoAP Signal Option Codes" cols="r l l c"}

The IANA policy for future additions to this sub-registry is based on
number ranges for the option numbers, analogous to the policy defined
in Section 12.2 of {{-coap}}.

## Service Name and Port Number Registration

IANA is requested to assign the port number 5683 and the service name "coap+tcp",
in accordance with {{RFC6335}}.

Similarly, IANA is requested to assign the
service name "coaps+tcp", in accordance with {{RFC6335}}.
However, no separate port number is used for "coaps" over TCP; instead,
the ALPN protocol ID defined in {{alpnpid}} is used over port 443.

## URI Scheme Registration

This document registers two new URI schemes, namely "coap+tcp" and
"coaps+tcp", for the use of CoAP over TCP and for CoAP over TLS over
TCP, respectively. The "coap+tcp" and "coaps+tcp" URI schemes can thus
be compared to the "http" and "https" URI schemes.

The syntax of the "coap" and "coaps" URI schemes is specified in
Section 6 of {{RFC7252}} and the present document re-uses their
semantics for "coap+tcp" and "coaps+tcp", respectively, with the
exception that TCP, or TLS over TCP is used as a transport protocol.

IANA is requested to add these new URI schemes to the registry
established with {{-urireg}}.

# CoAP over WebSocket Examples {#websocket-examples}

This section gives examples for the first two configurations
discussed in {{websockets-overview}}.

An example of the process followed by a CoAP client to retrieve the
representation of a resource identified by a "coap+ws" URI might be as
follows. {{example-1}} below illustrates the WebSocket and
CoAP messages exchanged in detail.

1. The CoAP client obtains the URI
  \<coap+ws://example.org/sensors/temperature?u=Cel>,
  for example, from a resource representation that it retrieved
  previously.

1. It establishes a WebSocket Connection to the endpoint URI composed
  of the authority "example.org" and the well-known path
  "/.well-known/coap", \<ws://example.org/.well-known/coap>.

1. It sends a single-frame, masked, binary message containing a CoAP
  request. The request indicates the target resource with the
  Uri-Path ("sensors", "temperature") and Uri-Query ("u=Cel")
  options.

1. It waits for the server to return a response.

1. The CoAP client uses the connection for further requests, or the
  connection is closed.

{: #example-1 title='A CoAP client retrieves the representation of a resource identified by a "coap+ws" URI'}

{{example-2}} shows how a CoAP client uses a CoAP
forward proxy with a WebSocket endpoint to retrieve the representation
of the resource "coap://[2001:DB8::1]/". The use of the forward
proxy and the address of the WebSocket endpoint are determined by the
client from local configuration rules. The request URI is specified
in the Proxy-Uri Option. Since the request URI uses the "coap" URI
scheme, the proxy fulfills the request by issuing a Confirmable GET
request over UDP to the CoAP server and returning the response over
the WebSocket connection to the client.
