 CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets
                  draft-ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls-latest

Abstract

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), although inspired by
   HTTP, was designed to use UDP instead of TCP.  The message layer of
   the CoAP over UDP protocol includes support for reliable delivery,
   simple congestion control, and flow control.

   Some environments benefit from the availability of CoAP carried over
   reliable transports such as TCP or TLS.  This document outlines the
   changes required to use CoAP over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets
   transports.  It also formally updates [RFC7641] for use with these
   transports.

1.  Introduction

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] was designed
   for Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, assuming that UDP [RFC0768]
   or DTLS [RFC6347] over UDP can be used unimpeded.  UDP is a good
   choice for transferring small amounts of data across networks that
   follow the IP architecture.

   Some CoAP deployments need to integrate well with existing enterprise
   infrastructures, where UDP-based protocols may not be well-received
   or may even be blocked by firewalls.  Middleboxes that are unaware of
   CoAP usage for IoT can make the use of UDP brittle, resulting in lost
   or malformed packets.

   Emerging standards such as Lightweight Machine to Machine [LWM2M]
   currently use CoAP over UDP as a transport and require support for
   CoAP over TCP to address the issues above and to protect investments
   in existing CoAP implementations and deployments.  Although HTTP/2

   could also potentially address these requirements, there would be
   additional costs and delays introduced by such a transition.
   Currently, there are also fewer HTTP/2 implementations available for
   constrained devices in comparison to CoAP.

   To address these requirements, this document defines how to transport
   CoAP over TCP, CoAP over TLS, and CoAP over WebSockets.  Figure 1
   illustrates the layering:

   Where NATs are present, CoAP over TCP can help with their traversal.
   NATs often calculate expiration timers based on the transport layer
   protocol being used by application protocols.  Many NATs maintain
   TCP-based NAT bindings for longer periods based on the assumption
   that a transport layer protocol, such as TCP, offers additional
   information about the session life cycle.  UDP, on the other hand,
   does not provide such information to a NAT and timeouts tend to be
   much shorter [HomeGateway].

   Some environments may also benefit from the ability of TCP to
   exchange larger payloads, such as firmware images, without
   application layer segmentation and to utilize the more sophisticated
   congestion control capabilities provided by many TCP implementations.
   Note that there is ongoing work to add more elaborate congestion
   control to CoAP (see [I-D.ietf-core-cocoa]).

   CoAP may be integrated into a Web environment where the front-end
   uses CoAP over UDP from IoT devices to a cloud infrastructure and
   then CoAP over TCP between the back-end services.  A TCP-to-UDP
   gateway can be used at the cloud boundary to communicate with the
   UDP-based IoT device.

   To allow IoT devices to better communicate in these demanding
   environments, CoAP needs to support different transport protocols,
   namely TCP [RFC0793], in some situations secured by TLS [RFC5246].

   In addition, some corporate networks only allow Internet access via a
   HTTP proxy.  In this case, the best transport for CoAP might be the
   WebSocket Protocol [RFC6455].  The WebSocket protocol provides two-
   way communication between a client and a server after upgrading an
   HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230] connection and may be available in an environment
   that blocks CoAP over UDP.  Another scenario for CoAP over WebSockets
   is a CoAP application running inside a web browser without access to
   connectivity other than HTTP and WebSockets.

   This document specifies how to access resources using CoAP requests
   and responses over the TCP/TLS and WebSocket protocols.  This allows
   connectivity-limited applications to obtain end-to-end CoAP
   connectivity either by communicating CoAP directly with a CoAP server
   accessible over a TCP/TLS or WebSocket connection or via a CoAP
   intermediary that proxies CoAP requests and responses between
   different transports, such as between WebSockets and UDP.

   Appendix A updates Observing Resources in the Constrained Application
   Protocol [RFC7641] for use with CoAP over reliable transports.
   [RFC7641] is an extension to the CoAP core protocol that enables CoAP
   clients to "observe" a resource on a CoAP server.  (The client
   retrieves a representation of a resource and registers to be notified
   by the server when the representation is updated.)

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   This document assumes that readers are familiar with the terms and
   concepts that are used in [RFC6455], [RFC7252], [RFC7641], and
   [RFC7959].

   The term "reliable transport" is used only to refer to transport
   protocols such as TCP which provide reliable and ordered delivery of
   a byte-stream.

   BERT Option:
      A Block1 or Block2 option that includes an SZX value of 7.

   BERT Block:
      The payload of a CoAP message that is affected by a BERT Option in
      descriptive usage (Section 2.1 of [RFC7959]).

   For simplicity, a Payload Marker (0xFF) is present in all examples
   for message formats:



Bormann, et al.           Expires July 3, 2017                  [Page 5]

       ...
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1|    Payload (if any) ...
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Payload Marker indicates the start of the optional payload and is
   absent for zero-length payloads (see section 3 of [RFC7252]).

2.  CoAP over TCP

   The request/response interaction model of CoAP over TCP is the same
   as CoAP over UDP.  The primary differences are in the message layer.
   The message layer of CoAP over UDP supports optional reliability by
   defining four Types of messages: Confirmable, Non-confirmable,
   Acknowledgement, and Reset.  In addition, messages include a Message
   ID to relate Acknowledgments to Confirmable messages and to detect
   duplicate messages.

2.1.  Messaging Model

   Conceptually, CoAP over TCP replaces most of the message layer of
   CoAP over UDP with a framing mechanism on top of the byte-stream
   provided by TCP/TLS, conveying the length information for each
   message that on datagram transports is provided by the UDP/DTLS
   datagram layer.

   TCP ensures reliable message transmission, so the message layer of
   CoAP over TCP is not required to support acknowledgements or to
   detect duplicate messages.  As a result, both the Type and Message ID
   fields are no longer required and are removed from the CoAP over TCP
   message format.

   Figure 2 illustrates the difference between CoAP over UDP and CoAP
   over reliable transport.  The removed Type and Message ID fields are
   indicated by dashes.

2.2.  Message Format

   The CoAP message format defined in [RFC7252], as shown in Figure 3,
   relies on the datagram transport (UDP, or DTLS over UDP) for keeping
   the individual messages separate and for providing length
   information.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

              Figure 3: RFC 7252 defined CoAP Message Format

   The CoAP over TCP message format is very similar to the format
   specified for CoAP over UDP.  The differences are as follows:

   o  Since the underlying TCP connection provides retransmissions and
      deduplication, there is no need for the reliability mechanisms
      provided by CoAP over UDP.  The Type (T) and Message ID fields in
      the CoAP message header are elided.

Internet-Draft   TCP/TLS/WebSockets Transports for CoAP    December 2016


   o  The Version (Vers) field is elided as well.  In contrast to the
      message format of CoAP over UDP, the message format for CoAP over
      TCP does not include a version number.  CoAP is defined in
      [RFC7252] with a version number of 1.  At this time, there is no
      known reason to support version numbers different from 1.  If
      version negotiation needs to be addressed in the future, then
      Capabilities and Settings Messages (CSM see Section 4.3) have been
      specifically designed to enable such a potential feature.

   o  In a stream oriented transport protocol such as TCP, a form of
      message delimitation is needed.  For this purpose, CoAP over TCP
      introduces a length field with variable size.  Figure 4 shows the
      adjusted CoAP message format with a modified structure for the
      fixed header (first 4 bytes of the CoAP over UDP header), which
      includes the length information of variable size, shown here as an
      8-bit length.

    0                   1                   2                   3

      reserved for special constructs:

      13:  An 8-bit unsigned integer (Extended Length) follows the
         initial byte and indicates the length of options/payload minus
         13.

      14:  A 16-bit unsigned integer (Extended Length) in network byte
         order follows the initial byte and indicates the length of
         options/payload minus 269.

      15:  A 32-bit unsigned integer (Extended Length) in network byte
         order follows the initial byte and indicates the length of
         options/payload minus 65805.

   The encoding of the Length field is modeled on CoAP Options (see
   section 3.1 of [RFC7252]).

   The semantics of the other CoAP header fields are left unchanged.

2.3.  Message Transmission

   Once a connection is established, both the client and the server MUST
   send a Capabilities and Settings message (CSM see Section 4.3) as its
   first message on the connection.  This message establishes the
   initial settings and capabilities for the endpoint such as maximum
   message size or support for block-wise transfers.  The absence of
   options in the CSM indicates that base values are assumed.

   To avoid unnecessary latency, a client MAY send additional messages
   without waiting to receive the server CSM; however, it is important
   to note that the server CSM might advertise capabilities that impact
   how a client is expected to communicate with the server.  For
   example, the server CSM could advertise a Max-Message-Size option
   (see Section 4.3.2) that is smaller than the base value (1152).

   Clients and servers MUST treat a missing or invalid CSM as a
   connection error and abort the connection (see Section 4.6).

   CoAP requests and responses are exchanged asynchronously over the
   TCP/TLS connection.  A CoAP client can send multiple requests without
   waiting for a response and the CoAP server can return responses in
   any order.  Responses MUST be returned over the same connection as
   the originating request.  Concurrent requests are differentiated by
   their Token, which is scoped locally to the connection.

   The connection is bi-directional, so requests can be sent both by the
   entity that established the connection and the remote host.

   Retransmission and deduplication of messages is provided by the TCP/
   TLS protocol.

Internet-Draft   TCP/TLS/WebSockets Transports for CoAP    December 2016


2.4.  Connection Health

   Empty messages (Code 0.00) can always be sent and MUST be ignored by
   the recipient.  This provides a basic keep-alive function that can
   refresh NAT bindings.

   If a client does not receive any response for some time after sending
   a CoAP request (or, similarly, when a client observes a resource and
   it does not receive any notification for some time), it can send a
   CoAP Ping Signaling message (Section 4.4) to test the connection and
   verify that the server is responsive.

3.  CoAP over WebSockets

   CoAP over WebSockets is intentionally similar to CoAP over TCP;
   therefore, this section only specifies the differences between the
   transports.

   CoAP over WebSockets can be used in a number of configurations.  The
   most basic configuration is a CoAP client retrieving or updating a
   CoAP resource located on a CoAP server that exposes a WebSocket
   endpoint (Figure 9).  The CoAP client acts as the WebSocket client,
   establishes a WebSocket connection, and sends a CoAP request, to
   which the CoAP server returns a CoAP response.  The WebSocket
   connection can be used for any number of requests.

       Figure 9: CoAP Client (WebSocket client) accesses CoAP Server
                            (WebSocket server)

   The challenge with this configuration is how to identify a resource
   in the namespace of the CoAP server.  When the WebSocket protocol is
   used by a dedicated client directly (i.e., not from a web page
   through a web browser), the client can connect to any WebSocket
   endpoint.  Section 6.3 and Section 6.4 define new URI schemes that
   enable the client to identify both a WebSocket endpoint and the path
   and query of the CoAP resource within that endpoint.  When the
   WebSocket protocol is used from a web page, the choices are more
   limited [RFC6454], but the challenge persists.

Internet-Draft   TCP/TLS/WebSockets Transports for CoAP    December 2016


   Another possible configuration is to set up a CoAP forward proxy at
   the WebSocket endpoint.  Depending on what transports are available
   to the proxy, it could forward the request to a CoAP server with a
   CoAP UDP endpoint (Figure 10), an SMS endpoint (a.k.a. mobile phone),
   or even another WebSocket endpoint.  The client specifies the
   resource to be updated or retrieved in the Proxy-Uri Option.

    Figure 10: CoAP Client (WebSocket client) accesses CoAP Server (UDP
          server) via a CoAP proxy (WebSocket server/UDP client)

   A third possible configuration is a CoAP server running inside a web
   browser (Figure 11).  The web browser initially connects to a
   WebSocket endpoint and is then reachable through the WebSocket
   server.  When no connection exists, the CoAP server is unreachable.
   Because the WebSocket server is the only way to reach the CoAP
   server, the CoAP proxy should be a Reverse Proxy.

   Further configurations are possible, including those where a
   WebSocket connection is established through an HTTP proxy.

3.1.  Opening Handshake

   Before CoAP requests and responses are exchanged, a WebSocket
   connection is established as defined in Section 4 of [RFC6455].
   Figure 12 shows an example.

   The WebSocket client MUST include the subprotocol name "coap" in the
   list of protocols, which indicates support for the protocol defined
   in this document.  Any later, incompatible versions of CoAP or CoAP
   over WebSockets will use a different subprotocol name.

   The WebSocket client includes the hostname of the WebSocket server in
   the Host header field of its handshake as per [RFC6455].  The Host
   header field also indicates the default value of the Uri-Host Option
   in requests from the WebSocket client to the WebSocket server.

            GET /.well-known/coap HTTP/1.1
            Host: example.org
            Upgrade: websocket
            Connection: Upgrade
            Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
            Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: coap

            Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: coap

                Figure 12: Example of an Opening Handshake

3.2.  Message Format

   Once a WebSocket connection is established, CoAP requests and
   responses can be exchanged as WebSocket messages.  Since CoAP uses a
   binary message format, the messages are transmitted in binary data
   frames as specified in Sections 5 and 6 of [RFC6455].

   The message format shown in Figure 13 is the same as the CoAP over
   TCP message format (see Section 2.2) with one change.  The Length
   (Len) field MUST be set to zero because the WebSockets frame contains
   the length.

              Figure 13: CoAP Message Format over WebSockets

   As with CoAP over TCP, the message format for CoAP over Websockets
   eliminates the Version field defined in CoAP over UDP.  If CoAP
   version negotiation is required in the future, CoAP over WebSockets
   can address the requirement by the definition of a new subprotocol
   identifier that is negotiated during the opening handshake.

   Requests and response messages can be fragmented as specified in
   Section 5.4 of [RFC6455], though typically they are sent unfragmented
   as they tend to be small and fully buffered before transmission.  The
   WebSocket protocol does not provide means for multiplexing.  If it is
   not desirable for a large message to monopolize the connection,
   requests and responses can be transferred in a block-wise fashion as
   defined in [RFC7959].

3.3.  Message Transmission

   As with CoAP over TCP, both the client and the server MUST send a
   Capabilities and Settings message (CSM see Section 4.3) as its first
   message on the WebSocket connection.

   CoAP requests and responses are exchanged asynchronously over the
   WebSocket connection.  A CoAP client can send multiple requests
   without waiting for a response and the CoAP server can return
   responses in any order.  Responses MUST be returned over the same
   connection as the originating request.  Concurrent requests are
   differentiated by their Token, which is scoped locally to the
   connection.

   The connection is bi-directional, so requests can be sent both by the
   entity that established the connection and the remote host.

   As with CoAP over TCP, retransmission and deduplication of messages
   is provided by the WebSocket protocol.  CoAP over WebSockets
   therefore does not make a distinction between Confirmable or Non-
   Confirmable messages, and does not provide Acknowledgement or Reset
   messages.

Internet-Draft   TCP/TLS/WebSockets Transports for CoAP    December 2016


3.4.  Connection Health

   As with CoAP over TCP, the client can test the health of the CoAP
   over WebSocket connection by sending a CoAP Ping Signaling message
   (Section 4.4).  WebSocket Ping and unsolicited Pong frames
   (Section 5.5 of [RFC6455]) SHOULD NOT be used to ensure that
   redundant maintenance traffic is not transmitted.

4.  Signaling

   Signaling messages are introduced to allow peers to:

   o  Related characteristics such as maximum message size for the
      connection

   o  Shut down the connection in an orderly fashion

   o  Provide diagnostic information when terminating a connection in
      response to a serious error condition

   Signaling is a third basic kind of message in CoAP, after requests
   and responses.  Signaling messages share a common structure with the
   existing CoAP messages.  There is a code, a token, options, and an
   optional payload.

   (See Section 3 of [RFC7252] for the overall structure, as adapted to
   the specific transport.)

4.1.  Signaling Codes

   A code in the 7.00-7.31 range indicates a Signaling message.  Values
   in this range are assigned by the "CoAP Signaling Codes" sub-registry
   (see Section 9.1).

   For each message, there is a sender and a peer receiving the message.

   Payloads in Signaling messages are diagnostic payloads as defined in
   Section 5.5.2 of [RFC7252]), unless otherwise defined by a Signaling
   message option.

4.2.  Signaling Option Numbers

   Option numbers for Signaling messages are specific to the message
   code.  They do not share the number space with CoAP options for
   request/response messages or with Signaling messages using other
   codes.





Bormann, et al.           Expires July 3, 2017                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft   TCP/TLS/WebSockets Transports for CoAP    December 2016


   Option numbers are assigned by the "CoAP Signaling Option Numbers"
   sub-registry (see Section 9.2).

   Signaling options are elective or critical as defined in
   Section 5.4.1 of [RFC7252].  If a Signaling option is critical and
   not understood by the receiver, it MUST abort the connection (see
   Section 4.6).  If the option is understood but cannot be processed,
   the option documents the behavior.

4.3.  Capabilities and Settings Messages (CSM)

   Capabilities and Settings messages (CSM) are used for two purposes:

   o  Each capability option advertises one capability of the sender to
      the recipient.

   o  Setting options indicate a setting that will be applied by the
      sender.

   One CSM MUST be sent by both endpoints at the start of the
   connection.  Further CSM MAY be sent at any other time by either
   endpoint over the lifetime of the connection.

   Both capability and setting options are cumulative.  A CSM does not
   invalidate a previously sent capability indication or setting even if
   it is not repeated.  A capability message without any option is a no-
   operation (and can be used as such).  An option that is sent might
   override a previous value for the same option.  The option defines
   how to handle this case if needed.

   Base values are listed below for CSM Options.  These are the values
   for the capability and setting before any Capabilities and Settings
   messages send a modified value.

   These are not default values for the option as defined in
   Section 5.4.4 in [RFC7252].  A default value would mean that an empty
   Capabilities and Settings message would result in the option being
   set to its default value.

   Capabilities and Settings messages are indicated by the 7.01 code
   (CSM).

4.3.1.  Server-Name Setting Option

   +--------+------------+-------------+--------+--------+-------------+

   A client can use the critical Server-Name Option to indicate the
   default value for the Uri-Host Options in the messages that it sends
   to the server.  It has the same restrictions as the Uri-Host Option
   (Section 5.10.1 of [RFC7252]).

   For TLS, the base value for the Server-Name Option is given by the
   SNI value.

   For Websockets, the base value for the Server-Name Option is given by
   the HTTP Host header field.

4.3.2.  Max-Message-Size Capability Option

   The sender can use the elective Max-Message-Size Option to indicate
   the maximum message size in bytes that it can receive.

   +--------+-----------+------------------+--------+--------+---------+
   | Number | Applies   | Name             | Format | Length |    Base |

   +--------+-----------+----------------+--------+--------+-----------+

   A sender can use the elective Block-wise Transfer Option to indicate
   that it supports the block-wise transfer protocol [RFC7959].

   If the option is not given, the peer has no information about whether
   block-wise transfers are supported by the sender or not.  An
   implementation that supports block-wise transfers SHOULD indicate the

   Block-wise Transfer Option.  If a Max-Message-Size Option is
   indicated with a value that is greater than 1152 (in the same or a
   different CSM message), the Block-wise Transfer Option also indicates
   support for BERT (see Section 5).

4.4.  Ping and Pong Messages

   In CoAP over reliable transports, Empty messages (Code 0.00) can
   always be sent and MUST be ignored by the recipient.  This provides a
   basic keep-alive function.  In contrast, Ping and Pong messages are a
   bidirectional exchange.

   Upon receipt of a Ping message, a single Pong message is returned
   with the identical token.  As with all Signaling messages, the
   recipient of a Ping or Pong message MUST ignore elective options it
   does not understand.

   Ping and Pong messages are indicated by the 7.02 code (Ping) and the
   7.03 code (Pong).

4.4.1.  Custody Option

     +--------+------------+---------+--------+--------+------------+
     | Number | Applies to | Name    | Format | Length | Base Value |
     +--------+------------+---------+--------+--------+------------+
     | 2      | Ping, Pong | Custody |  empty |      0 |     (none) |
     +--------+------------+---------+--------+--------+------------+

   When responding to a Ping message, the receiver can include an
   elective Custody Option in the Pong message.  This option indicates
   that the application has processed all the request/response messages
   received prior to the Ping message on the current connection.  (Note
   that there is no definition of specific application semantics for
   "processed", but there is an expectation that the receiver of a Pong
   Message with a Custody Option should be able to free buffers based on
   this indication.)

   A sender can also include an elective Custody Option in a Ping
   message to explicitly request the inclusion of an elective Custody
   Option in the corresponding Pong message.  The receiver SHOULD delay
   its Pong message until it finishes processing all the request/
   response messages received prior to the Ping message on the current
   connection.

4.5.  Release Messages

   A Release message indicates that the sender does not want to continue
   maintaining the connection and opts for an orderly shutdown.  The
   details are in the options.  A diagnostic payload (see Section 5.5.2
   of [RFC7252]) MAY be included.  A peer will normally respond to a
   Release message by closing the TCP/TLS connection.  Messages may be
   in flight when the sender decides to send a Release message.  The
   general expectation is that these will still be processed.

   Release messages are indicated by the 7.04 code (Release).

   Release messages can indicate one or more reasons using elective
   options.  The following options are defined:

   +--------+-----------+-----------------+--------+--------+----------+
   | Number | Applies   | Name            | Format | Length |     Base |
   |        | to        |                 |        |        |    Value |
   +--------+-----------+-----------------+--------+--------+----------+
   | 2      | Release   | Bad-Server-Name |  empty |      0 |   (none) |
   +--------+-----------+-----------------+--------+--------+----------+

   The elective Bad-Server-Name Option indicates that the default
   indicated by the CSM Server-Name Option is unlikely to be useful for
   this server.

   +--------+----------+-------------------+--------+--------+---------+
   | Number | Applies  | Name              | Format | Length |    Base |
   |        | to       |                   |        |        |   Value |
   +--------+----------+-------------------+--------+--------+---------+
   | 4      | Release  | Alternate-Address | string |  1-255 |  (none) |
   +--------+----------+-------------------+--------+--------+---------+

   The elective Alternative-Address Option requests the peer to instead
   open a connection of the same scheme as the present connection to the
   alternative transport address given.  Its value is in the form
   "authority" as defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC3986].

     +--------+------------+----------+--------+--------+------------+
     | Number | Applies to | Name     | Format | Length | Base Value |
     +--------+------------+----------+--------+--------+------------+
     | 6      | Release    | Hold-Off |   uint |    0-3 |     (none) |
     +--------+------------+----------+--------+--------+------------+

   The elective Hold-Off Option indicates that the server is requesting
   that the peer not reconnect to it for the number of seconds given in
   the value.

4.6.  Abort Messages

   An Abort message indicates that the sender is unable to continue
   maintaining the connection and cannot even wait for an orderly
   release.  The sender shuts down the connection immediately after the
   abort (and may or may not wait for a Release or Abort message or
   connection shutdown in the inverse direction).  A diagnostic payload
   (see Section 5.5.2 of [RFC7252]) SHOULD be included in the Abort
   message.  Messages may be in flight when the sender decides to send
   an Abort message.  The general expectation is that these will NOT be
   processed.

   Abort messages are indicated by the 7.05 code (Abort).

   Abort messages can indicate one or more reasons using elective
   options.  The following option is defined:

   +--------+-----------+----------------+--------+--------+-----------+
   | Number | Applies   | Name           | Format | Length |      Base |
   |        | to        |                |        |        |     Value |
   +--------+-----------+----------------+--------+--------+-----------+
   | 2      | Abort     | Bad-CSM-Option |   uint |    0-2 |    (none) |
   +--------+-----------+----------------+--------+--------+-----------+

   The elective Bad-CSM-Option Option indicates that the sender is
   unable to process the CSM option identified by its option number,
   e.g. when it is critical and the option number is unknown by the
   sender, or when there is parameter problem with the value of an
   elective option.  More detailed information SHOULD be included as a
   diagnostic payload.

   One reason for an sender to generate an Abort message is a general
   syntax error in the byte-stream received.  No specific option has
   been defined for this, as the details of that syntax error are best
   left to a diagnostic payload.

5.  Block-wise Transfer and Reliable Transports

   The message size restrictions defined in Section 4.6 of CoAP
   [RFC7252] to avoid IP fragmentation are not necessary when CoAP is
   used over a reliable transport.  While this suggests that the Block-
   wise transfer protocol [RFC7959] is also no longer needed, it remains
   applicable for a number of cases:

   o  large messages, such as firmware downloads, may cause undesired
      head-of-line blocking when a single TCP connection is used

   o  a UDP-to-TCP gateway may simply not have the context to convert a
      message with a Block Option into the equivalent exchange without
      any use of a Block Option (it would need to convert the entire
      blockwise exchange from start to end into a single exchange)

   The 'Block-wise Extension for Reliable Transport (BERT)' extends the
   Block protocol to enable the use of larger messages over a reliable
   transport.



Bormann, et al.           Expires July 3, 2017                 [Page 21]

Internet-Draft   TCP/TLS/WebSockets Transports for CoAP    December 2016


   The use of this new extension is signaled by sending Block1 or Block2
   Options with SZX == 7 (a "BERT option").  SZX == 7 is a reserved
   value in [RFC7959].

   In control usage, a BERT option is interpreted in the same way as the
   equivalent Option with SZX == 6, except that it also indicates the
   capability to process BERT blocks.  As with the basic Block protocol,
   the recipient of a CoAP request with a BERT option in control usage
   is allowed to respond with a different SZX value, e.g. to send a non-
   BERT block instead.

   In descriptive usage, a BERT Option is interpreted in the same way as
   the equivalent Option with SZX == 6, except that the payload is
   allowed to contain a multiple of 1024 bytes (non-final BERT block) or
   more than 1024 bytes (final BERT block).

   The recipient of a non-final BERT block (M=1) conceptually partitions
   the payload into a sequence of 1024-byte blocks and acts exactly as
   if it had received this sequence in conjunction with block numbers
   starting at, and sequentially increasing from, the block number given
   in the Block Option.  In other words, the entire BERT block is
   positioned at the byte position that results from multiplying the
   block number with 1024.  The position of further blocks to be
   transferred is indicated by incrementing the block number by the
   number of elements in this sequence (i.e., the size of the payload
   divided by 1024 bytes).

   As with SZX == 6, the recipient of a final BERT block (M=0) simply
   appends the payload at the byte position that is indicated by the
   block number multiplied with 1024.

   The following examples illustrate BERT options.  A value of SZX == 7
   is labeled as "BERT" or as "BERT(nnn)" to indicate a payload of size
   nnn.

   In all these examples, a Block Option is decomposed to indicate the
   kind of Block Option (1 or 2) followed by a colon, the block number
   (NUM), more bit (M), and block size exponent (2**(SZX+4)) separated
   by slashes.  E.g., a Block2 Option value of 33 would be shown as
   2:2/0/32), or a Block1 Option value of 59 would be shown as
   1:3/1/128.

5.1.  Example: GET with BERT Blocks

   Figure 16 shows a GET request with a response that is split into
   three BERT blocks.  The first response contains 3072 bytes of
   payload; the second, 5120; and the third, 4711.  Note how the block

   forward.

6.  CoAP over Reliable Transport URIs

   CoAP over UDP [RFC7252] defines the "coap" and "coaps" URI schemes.
   This document introduces four additional URI schemes for identifying
   CoAP resources and providing a means of locating the resource:

   o  the "coap+tcp" URI scheme for CoAP over TCP




Bormann, et al.           Expires July 3, 2017                 [Page 23]

Internet-Draft   TCP/TLS/WebSockets Transports for CoAP    December 2016


   o  the "coaps+tcp" URI scheme for CoAP over TCP secured by TLS

   o  the "coap+ws" URI scheme for CoAP over WebSockets

   o  the "coaps+ws" URI scheme for CoAP over WebSockets secured by TLS

   Resources made available via these schemes have no shared identity
   even if their resource identifiers indicate the same authority (the
   same host listening to the same TCP port).  They are distinct
   namespaces and are considered to be distinct origin servers.

   The syntax for the URI schemes in this section are specified using
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234].  The definitions of
   "host", "port", "path-abempty", and "query" are adopted from
   [RFC3986].

   Section 8 (Multicast CoAP) in [RFC7252] is not applicable to these
   schemes.

6.1.  coap+tcp URI scheme

   The "coap+tcp" URI scheme identifies CoAP resources that are intended
   to be accessible using CoAP over TCP.

     coap+tcp-URI =
        "coap+tcp:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path-abempty [ "?" query ]

   The syntax defined in Section 6.1 of [RFC7252] applies to this URI
   scheme with the following changes:

   o  The port subcomponent indicates the TCP port at which the CoAP
      server is located.  (If it is empty or not given, then the default
      port 5683 is assumed, as with UDP.)

   Encoding considerations:  The scheme encoding conforms to the
      encoding rules established for URIs in [RFC3986].

   Interoperability considerations:  None.

   Security considerations:  See Section 11.1 of [RFC7252].

6.2.  coaps+tcp URI scheme

   The "coaps+tcp" URI scheme identifies CoAP resources that are
   intended to be accessible using CoAP over TCP secured with TLS.

     coaps+tcp-URI =
        "coaps+tcp:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path-abempty [ "?" query ]

Internet-Draft   TCP/TLS/WebSockets Transports for CoAP    December 2016


   The syntax defined in Section 6.2 of [RFC7252] applies to this URI
   scheme, with the following changes:

   o  The port subcomponent indicates the TCP port at which the TLS
      server for the CoAP server is located.  If it is empty or not
      given, then the default port 443 is assumed (this is different
      from the default port for "coaps", i.e., CoAP over DTLS over UDP).

   o  If a TCP server does not support the Application-Layer Protocol
      Negotiation Extension (ALPN) [RFC7301] or wishes to accommodate
      TCP clients that do not support ALPN, it MAY offer a coaps+tcp
      endpoint on TCP port 5684.  This endpoint MAY also be ALPN
      enabled.  A TCP server MAY offer coaps+tcp endpoints on ports
      other than TCP port 5684, which MUST be ALPN enabled.

   o  For TCP ports other than port 5684, the TCP client MUST use the
      ALPN extension to advertise the "coap" protocol identifier (see
      Section 9.7) in the list of protocols in its ClientHello.  If the
      TCP server selects and returns the "coap" protocol identifier
      using the ALPN extension in its ServerHello, then the connection
      succeeds.  If the TCP server either does not negotiate the ALPN
      extension or returns a no_application_protocol alert, the TCP
      client MUST close the connection.

   o  For TCP port 5684, a TCP client MAY use the ALPN extension to
      advertise the "coap" protocol identifier in the list of protocols
      in its ClientHello.  If the TCP server selects and returns the
      "coap" protocol identifier using the ALPN extension in its
      ServerHello, then the connection succeeds.  If the TCP server
      returns a no_application_protocol alert, then the TCP client MUST
      close the connection.  If the TCP server does not negotiate the
      ALPN extension, then coaps+tcp is implicitly selected.

   o  For TCP port 5684, if the TCP client does not use the ALPN
      extension to negotiate the protocol, then coaps+tcp is implicitly
      selected.

   Encoding considerations:  The scheme encoding conforms to the
      encoding rules established for URIs in [RFC3986].

   Interoperability considerations:  None.

   Security considerations:  See Section 11.1 of [RFC7252].

6.3.  coap+ws URI scheme

   The "coap+ws" URI scheme identifies CoAP resources that are intended
   to be accessible using CoAP over WebSockets.

      coap-ws-URI =
         "coap+ws:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path-abempty [ "?" query ]

   The port component is OPTIONAL.  The default is port 80.

   The WebSocket endpoint is identified by a "ws" URI that is composed
   of the authority part of the "coap+ws" URI and the well-known path
   "/.well-known/coap" [RFC5785].  The path and query parts of a
   "coap+ws" URI identify a resource within the specified endpoint which
   can be operated on by the methods defined by CoAP:

             coap+ws://example.org/sensors/temperature?u=Cel
                  \______  ______/\___________  ___________/
                         \/                   \/

      encoding rules established for URIs in [RFC3986].

   Interoperability considerations:  None.

   Security considerations:  See Section 11.1 of [RFC7252].

6.4.  coaps+ws URI scheme

   The "coaps+ws" URI scheme identifies CoAP resources that are intended
   to be accessible using CoAP over WebSockets secured by TLS.

     coaps-ws-URI =
        "coaps+ws:" "//" host [ ":" port ] path-abempty [ "?" query ]

   The port component is OPTIONAL.  The default is port 443.

   The WebSocket endpoint is identified by a "wss" URI that is composed
   of the authority part of the "coaps+ws" URI and the well-known path
   "/.well-known/coap" [RFC5785].  The path and query parts of a
   "coaps+ws" URI identify a resource within the specified endpoint
   which can be operated on by the methods defined by CoAP.

   Encoding considerations:  The scheme encoding conforms to the
      encoding rules established for URIs in [RFC3986].

   Interoperability considerations:  None.

   Security considerations:  See Section 11.1 of [RFC7252].

6.5.  Decomposing URIs into Options

   The steps are the same as specified in Section 6.4 of [RFC7252] with
   the following changes:

   3.  If |url| does not have a <scheme> component whose value, when
       converted to ASCII lowercase, is "coap" or "coaps", then fail
       this algorithm.

   If |url| does not have a <scheme> component whose value, when
   converted to ASCII lowercase, is "coap+tcp", "coaps+tcp", "coap+ws",
   or "coaps+ws" then fail this algorithm.

   7.  If |port| does not equal the request's destination UDP port,
       include a Uri-Port Option and let that option's value be |port|.

   If |port| does not equal the request's destination TCP port, include
   a Uri-Port Option and let that option's value be |port|.

6.6.  Composing URIs from Options

   The steps are the same as specified in Section 6.5 of [RFC7252] with
   the following changes:

   1.  If the request is secured using DTLS, let |url| be the string
       "coaps://".  Otherwise, let |url| be the string "coap://".

   For CoAP over TCP, if the request is secured using TLS, let |url| be
   the string "coaps+tcp://".  Otherwise, let |url| be the string
   "coap+tcp://".  For CoAP over WebSockets, if the request is secured
   using TLS, let |url| be the string "coaps+ws://".  Otherwise,
   let |url| be the string "coap+ws://".

   4.  If the request includes a Uri-Port Option, let |port| be that
       option's value.  Otherwise, let |port| be the request's
       destination UDP port.

   If the request includes a Uri-Port Option, let |port| be that
   option's value.  Otherwise, let |port| be the request's destination
   TCP port.

7.  Securing CoAP

   Security Challenges for the Internet of Things [SecurityChallenges]
   recommends:

      ... it is essential that IoT protocol suites specify a mandatory
      to implement but optional to use security solution.  This will
      ensure security is available in all implementations, but
      configurable to use when not necessary (e.g., in closed
      environment).  ... even if those features stretch the capabilities
      of such devices.

   A security solution MUST be implemented to protect CoAP over TCP and
   MUST be enabled by default.  This document defines the TLS binding,
   but alternative solutions at different layers in the protocol stack
   MAY be used to protect CoAP over TCP when appropriate.  Note that
   there is ongoing work to support a data object-based security model
   for CoAP that is independent of transport (see
   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security]).

7.1.  TLS binding for CoAP over TCP

   The TLS usage guidance in [RFC7925] applies.

   During the provisioning phase, a CoAP device is provided with the
   security information that it needs, including keying materials,
   access control lists, and authorization servers.  At the end of the
   provisioning phase, the device will be in one of four security modes:

   NoSec:  TLS is disabled.

   PreSharedKey:  TLS is enabled.  The guidance in Section 4.2 of
      [RFC7925] applies.

   RawPublicKey:  TLS is enabled.  The guidance in Section 4.3 of
      [RFC7925] applies.

   Certificate:  TLS is enabled.  The guidance in Section 4.4 of
      [RFC7925] applies.

Internet-Draft   TCP/TLS/WebSockets Transports for CoAP    December 2016


   The "NoSec" mode is mandatory-to-implement.  The system simply sends
   the packets over normal TCP which is indicated by the "coap+tcp"
   scheme and the TCP CoAP default port.  The system is secured only by
   keeping attackers from being able to send or receive packets from the
   network with the CoAP nodes.

   "PreSharedKey", "RawPublicKey", or "Certificate" is mandatory-to-
   implement for the TLS binding depending on the credential type used
   with the device.  These security modes are achieved using TLS and are
   indicated by the "coaps+tcp" scheme and TLS-secured CoAP default
   port.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC7252] apply.  For CoAP over
   WebSockets and CoAP over TLS-secured WebSockets, the security
   considerations of [RFC6455] also apply.

8.1.  Signaling Messages

   o  The guidance given by an Alternative-Address Option cannot be
      followed blindly.  In particular, a peer MUST NOT assume that a
      successful connection to the Alternative-Address inherits all the
      security properties of the current connection.

   o  SNI vs. Server-Name: Any security negotiated in the TLS handshake
      is for the SNI name exchanged in the TLS handshake and checked
      against the certificate provided by the server.  The Server-Name
      Option cannot be used to extend these security properties to the
      additional server name.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  Signaling Codes

   IANA is requested to create a third sub-registry for values of the
   Code field in the CoAP header (Section 12.1 of [RFC7252]).  The name
   of this sub-registry is "CoAP Signaling Codes".

   Each entry in the sub-registry must include the Signaling Code in the
   range 7.00-7.31, its name, and a reference to its documentation.

   Initial entries in this sub-registry are as follows:

   All other Signaling Codes are Unassigned.

   The IANA policy for future additions to this sub-registry is "IETF
   Review or IESG Approval" as described in [RFC5226].

9.2.  CoAP Signaling Option Numbers Registry

   IANA is requested to create a sub-registry for Options Numbers used
   in CoAP signaling options within the "CoRE Parameters" registry.  The
   name of this sub-registry is "CoAP Signaling Option Numbers".

   Each entry in the sub-registry must include one or more of the codes
   in the Signaling Codes subregistry (Section 9.1), the option number,
   the name of the option, and a reference to the option's
   documentation.

   Initial entries in this sub-registry are as follows:

Appendix A.  Updates to RFC7641 Observing Resources in the Constrained
             Application Protocol (CoAP)

A.1.  Notifications and Reordering

   When using the Observe Option with CoAP over UDP, notifications from
   the server set the option value to an increasing sequence number for
   reordering detection on the client since messages can arrive in a
   different order than they were sent.  This sequence number is not
   required for CoAP over reliable transports since the TCP protocol
   ensures reliable and ordered delivery of messages.  The value of the
   Observe Option in 2.xx notifications MAY be empty on transmission and
   MUST be ignored on reception.

A.2.  Transmission and Acknowledgements

   For CoAP over UDP, server notifications to the client can be
   confirmable or non-confirmable.  A confirmable message requires the
   client to either respond with an acknowledgement message or a reset
   message.  An acknowledgement message indicates that the client is
   alive and wishes to receive further notifications.  A reset message
   indicates that the client does not recognize the token which causes
   the server to remove the associated entry from the list of observers.

   Since TCP eliminates the need for the message layer to support
   reliability, CoAP over reliable transports does not support
   confirmable or non-confirmable message types.  All notifications are



Bormann, et al.           Expires July 3, 2017                 [Page 38]

Internet-Draft   TCP/TLS/WebSockets Transports for CoAP    December 2016


   delivered reliably to the client with positive acknowledgement of
   receipt occurring at the TCP level.  If the client does not recognize
   the token in a notification, it MAY immediately abort the connection
   (see Section 4.6).

A.3.  Freshness

   For CoAP over UDP, if a client does not receive a notification for
   some time, it MAY send a new GET request with the same token as the
   original request to re-register its interest in a resource and verify
   that the server is still responsive.  For CoAP over reliable
   transports, it is more efficient to check the health of the
   connection (and all its active observations) by sending a CoAP Ping
   Signaling message (Section 4.4) rather than individual requests to
   confirm active observations.

A.4.  Cancellation

   For CoAP over UDP, a client that is no longer interested in receiving
   notifications can "forget" the observation and respond to the next
   notification from the server with a reset message to cancel the
   observation.

   For CoAP over reliable transports, a client MUST explicitly
   deregister by issuing a GET request that has the Token field set to
   the token of the observation to be cancelled and includes an Observe
   Option with the value set to 1 (deregister).

   If the client observes one or more resources over a reliable
   transport, then the CoAP server (or intermediary in the role of the
   CoAP server) MUST remove all entries associated with the client
   endpoint from the lists of observers when the connection is either
   closed or times out.

Appendix B.  CoAP over WebSocket Examples

   This section gives examples for the first two configurations
   discussed in Section 3.

   An example of the process followed by a CoAP client to retrieve the
   representation of a resource identified by a "coap+ws" URI might be
   as follows.  Figure 20 below illustrates the WebSocket and CoAP
   messages exchanged in detail.

   1.  The CoAP client obtains the URI <coap+ws://example.org/sensors/
       temperature?u=Cel>, for example, from a resource representation
       that it retrieved previously.

   2.  It establishes a WebSocket connection to the endpoint URI
       composed of the authority "example.org" and the well-known path
       "/.well-known/coap", <ws://example.org/.well-known/coap>.

   3.  It sends a single-frame, masked, binary message containing a CoAP
       request.  The request indicates the target resource with the Uri-
       Path ("sensors", "temperature") and Uri-Query ("u=Cel") options.

   4.  It waits for the server to return a response.

   5.  The CoAP client uses the connection for further requests, or the
       connection is closed.

   Figure 21 shows how a CoAP client uses a CoAP forward proxy with a
   WebSocket endpoint to retrieve the representation of the resource
   "coap://[2001:DB8::1]/".  The use of the forward proxy and the
   address of the WebSocket endpoint are determined by the client from
   local configuration rules.  The request URI is specified in the
   Proxy-Uri Option.  Since the request URI uses the "coap" URI scheme,
   the proxy fulfills the request by issuing a Confirmable GET request
   over UDP to the CoAP server and returning the response over the
   WebSocket connection to the client.
